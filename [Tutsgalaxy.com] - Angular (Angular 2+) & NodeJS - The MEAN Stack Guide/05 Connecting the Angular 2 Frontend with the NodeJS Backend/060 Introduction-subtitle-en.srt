1
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,068
<v Instructor>So here is where we left in the last module.</v>

2
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:07,922
We finished our Angular 2 front end,

3
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:09,608
or most parts of it.

4
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:12,578
We're able to create messages here.

5
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:14,385
We're also able to click Edit,

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:16,902
though we only edit them in a static way.

7
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:18,699
And we can delete them.

8
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:20,474
But all of that is happening in the front end.

9
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:22,759
We're not really connecting to a server.

10
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:25,484
And this is the reason why if we create a message here

11
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,956
and we reload, the message is gone,

12
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:30,064
because it isn't saved anywhere.

13
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:33,584
Also, we get the authentication route here,

14
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:37,314
but even though we're able to fill out this form,

15
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:41,154
we're not really able to save the user on the back end,

16
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:44,614
or well, really create a user on our server.

17
00:00:44,614 --> 00:00:47,464
So these are the two missing things in this application.

18
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,394
And these are the things which really make this

19
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:53,964
a course about Angular 2 and NodeJS,

20
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:56,364
because until now, we really only had to look at

21
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:58,174
the Angular 2 part here.

22
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:00,084
Now it's time to make the next step

23
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:04,334
and also implement our back end with NodeJS.

24
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:07,634
We already set up our back end basics in the NodeJS

25
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,544
and the MongoDB sections in this course, though.

26
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:12,783
We already have our models,

27
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:17,503
and we got our app.js file, which controls our request flow,

28
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:21,519
and we got our app.js file here in the routes folder,

29
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,130
which renders our root route, this index page here,

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,770
which starts our Angular 2 application.

31
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,329
Now it's time to add more routes to allow Angular 2

32
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,496
to reach out to our back end and then do something there.

33
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:39,271
Remember this slide from the very beginning?

34
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:42,744
It shows how we connect Angular 2 and NodeJS.

35
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:46,503
We get our Angular 2 application and then we reach out

36
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:49,071
to the server whenever we need something.

37
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:51,688
We request data, that could also be that we request

38
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:54,937
to store some data, but in the end we reach out

39
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:57,488
to the server because we want something to happen.

40
00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:01,434
And then on the server, it's NodeJS and ExpressJS

41
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:04,572
and MongoDB's job to do something with the data

42
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:08,129
we sent there, or give us the data we're requesting,

43
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,164
but in the end, to send us back a response

44
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,288
and tell if the action was successful

45
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:14,877
and possibly the data we wanted.

46
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:18,277
So this separation is key to understand,

47
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:20,628
because that is what we're going to work on now.

48
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:22,474
We're going to work on this server part

49
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:26,285
and set up some routes to which Angular 2 can connect

50
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:29,755
so that Angular 2 knows how to, well, get data,

51
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:31,952
store data, and so on.

52
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:35,869
Let's start with the route for saving messages.
