1
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,612
<v Instructor>Now saving the message is actually</v>

2
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:07,641
the most complicated method or thing to do here,

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:11,550
but no worries, it's not that complicated in the end.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,382
I'll set up a new route here,

5
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:15,108
and this will be a patch route.

6
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:18,430
Patch is a HDP word you'll commonly use to

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,612
change existing data, put would be an alternative

8
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:24,700
if you want to simply override the existing one.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,182
Here, we expect the slash route.

10
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:31,212
Again this has message in front of it automatically,

11
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:34,902
but here I also want to pass the id as a parameter,

12
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:37,822
the id of the message we want to work on,

13
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:39,690
or we want to update.

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,550
Then we have the well-known callback function here,

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,102
as we always do.

16
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:48,532
And now inside of here, the job is to use

17
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:51,588
the message object, the message model,

18
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:53,611
to find the message.

19
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:57,390
Now here, I can use the handy find by id method here,

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,132
and then pass the id, which gets passed as a parameter,

21
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:06,873
so let's access it on request params and then id.

22
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:09,241
The name I chose here in the path.

23
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,479
In this case, I'll execute another callback,

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,646
where I either get an error or my message if we do find it.

25
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:22,661
So, here first, let's handle the error that we have

26
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:24,578
problems fetching this.

27
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:30,454
In this case, I want to return the same error as always.

28
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:32,973
Let's return this one here.

29
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,694
We could also encounter the case

30
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,027
that we don't have an error,

31
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:42,894
but message is not found because we don't have that id.

32
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,625
In this case, I also want to return the status code of 500,

33
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:51,458
but let's give it a title of no message found,

34
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:56,134
something like this, and of course, all the pass the error,

35
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:58,734
though here, I don't pass the error object

36
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:02,241
because remember, error here is only set in the first

37
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:04,801
if block, not necessarily in this one,

38
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:06,667
because we don't have an error,

39
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,522
we just don't find the message.

40
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:11,893
So here, I will create my own one, and to be consistent

41
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:15,025
about these errors, I later on want to be able to retrieve

42
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:17,585
detailed errors messages.

43
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:21,116
The errors found by mongoose, these ones here,

44
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:23,316
will contain the message property,

45
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:26,766
therefore my custom object here will also get one.

46
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:30,276
This is a good practise to make sure that you're really

47
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:33,778
able to show your errors on the front-end,

48
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,718
and that your errors have a specific format

49
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:39,410
with it you can work on the front-end.

50
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,519
So here, you can enter any error text you want.

51
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,696
Here, I will simply say message not found, which of course,

52
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:49,919
also is the title, but you can make this more detailed.

53
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,428
Now the final step is to save or to update this message.

54
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:56,458
So here, I want to access message content,

55
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,535
since this is the field we're changing, and instead

56
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:03,039
of the call to request, and now where is the content

57
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,087
of the new message or of the updated message?

58
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:09,399
Well, this is send in the request body, so a patch request

59
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,380
typically has both:

60
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,930
some data in the path, like the id parameter,

61
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,700
and some date in the body.

62
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,970
So let's access request body content,

63
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,780
for the updated message content, and thereafter, I can call

64
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,810
message saved, like I did when creating a new message.

65
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,143
Here again, of course, with the callback

66
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,427
the error or the result, and now I can just copy the code

67
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:42,219
from the post route here where I created new message.

68
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:45,679
We either have an error or we are successful,

69
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:50,323
but I will change the status code to 200 here then,

70
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:53,908
and I'll rename it to updated message.

71
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:57,148
Now this is my backend function, far as getting the message,

72
00:03:57,148 --> 00:04:02,046
checking for errors, and if I actually did get the message,

73
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:05,777
and then changing it, and lastly, saving the

74
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:08,348
well, changed message back to the database.

75
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,508
Mongoose will hear automatically not create a new one,

76
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:13,849
but simply override the old one,

77
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,016
or override the change fields in the old one to be precise.

78
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,699
With this set up, it's time to go back to the front-end

79
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,282
and hook it up to this backend.
