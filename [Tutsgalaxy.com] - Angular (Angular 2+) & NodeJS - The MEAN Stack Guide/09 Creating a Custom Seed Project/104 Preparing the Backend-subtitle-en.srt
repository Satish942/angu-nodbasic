1
00:00:00,532 --> 00:00:03,701
<v ->I added a gitignore file chest</v>

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:05,996
if your using get to ignore my id files

3
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:07,198
to node_modules folder,

4
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:09,318
which we can always recreate with npmInstall,

5
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:11,300
and a public js folder, which is

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,448
where I want to store my compiled Angular 2 app.

7
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,096
And I don't want to store it on git

8
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:18,418
because I can always recompile it.

9
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,225
That's a good thing, though.

10
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,340
In the public folder, it doesn't look like

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,617
an A2 Project.

12
00:00:23,617 --> 00:00:25,695
Now, you may use this set up if you want to.

13
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,332
I'll get rid of the image folder,

14
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:30,147
and I'll rename JavaScript to just js.

15
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:31,547
Just a peripheral preference.

16
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:33,097
You don't have to do this.

17
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:34,874
More important than that,

18
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:36,609
I'll get rid of the users.js file

19
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:37,974
in the routes folder,

20
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:40,610
and I'll rename index.js to app.js,

21
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,610
but, of course, you may keep this named

22
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,734
to index.js.

23
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,632
I'm just renaming it because this was

24
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:48,167
what I used throughout the course.

25
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,298
In the views file folder here,

26
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:51,969
I can also get rid of the layout.

27
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,894
We're not going to use a general layout

28
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:54,869
for our views,

29
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,448
and I'll get rid of the err.hbx file.

30
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,334
We're not going to render an error file

31
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:01,667
because, remember that I always want

32
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,511
to send the Angular 2 application

33
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,583
in the case of a 404 error,

34
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,193
so no need to have a separate page for that.

35
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,846
The index.hbs file, I'll clean it,

36
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:12,079
I'll empty it for now.

37
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,672
We'll work on that later.

38
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:17,597
For now, to finish the service side code here,

39
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:20,732
let's have a look at the bin www file.

40
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:23,168
And here the default setup should be fine.

41
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:25,097
Nothing you need to change here.

42
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:27,401
We need to adjust the app.js file

43
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:28,849
in the root folder, though.

44
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,940
Generally, this setup is okay.

45
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,766
But the first thing I will change is here.

46
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:36,653
I will remove this users routes variable

47
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:38,870
because we deleted this file

48
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,351
in the routes folder.

49
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,336
And I will rename routes here to appRoutes

50
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,847
and require my app file in the routes folder.

51
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:48,224
Like this.

52
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:50,169
This is the first thing.

53
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:51,572
The next thing I want to do is

54
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:54,720
I want to change the way we handle errors.

55
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,579
I get rid of all the error handlers down there.

56
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,899
And in the case here, when we have an error,

57
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,882
I don't want to throw an error.

58
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:04,852
I don't want to show an error page.

59
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:06,625
Instead, I always want to render

60
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,710
the index.hbs file to let Angular 2 take over.

61
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,510
So, all I do here, if we reach this point,

62
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,760
is I render the index.hbs file

63
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,067
to always give me back

64
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,834
that Angular 2 application.

65
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:21,964
Well, and then here,

66
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,141
I will also get rid of this app.use

67
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,328
middleware here.

68
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,606
We no longer have the users variable

69
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,189
which stored this users routes file.

70
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:31,695
So let's delete it.

71
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:32,838
Right now I want to handle

72
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:34,376
all my incoming requests here

73
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:36,710
with the appRoute variable,

74
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,192
which points to this routes or this app.js file

75
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,060
in the routes folder.

76
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,731
There's one other thing I want to add here.

77
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,661
We don't need it for this course,

78
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:49,967
but you will need if your Angular 2 application

79
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:51,591
runs on a different server

80
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,977
than your backend is on.

81
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:55,949
In this case, you would get course errors,

82
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:58,114
which means you're trying to access

83
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:00,465
your backend from a different origin

84
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:03,504
because your front end is on a different server.

85
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,190
This is not allowed by default.

86
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,411
To allow it here, I'll add my own custom

87
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:10,990
middleware by using app.use.

88
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,890
Using the command here express gives me

89
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,470
to add a middleware being run on every request.

90
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,303
And I will pass the default express middleware

91
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:25,474
function here as a callback with request,

92
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:27,172
response, and this next function

93
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,618
I can execute to let

94
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:31,031
the request continue its journey.

95
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:33,467
And here I will set up some headers.

96
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,276
Now, I already prepared them,

97
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:37,102
and I will copy them in here

98
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:39,441
and quickly explain what they do.

99
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:43,296
The first one allows any other domain

100
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:45,020
to access this server.

101
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,880
You could restrict this to certain domains

102
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,199
or IP addresses.

103
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,066
Here, I'll allow every source

104
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:51,648
to access this server.

105
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,676
And just as a side note

106
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:54,009
so that you don't get this wrong,

107
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,860
we're not talking about sensible server access

108
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,131
in the sense of accessing it through SSH.

109
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,185
I'm talking about incoming requests

110
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:03,435
over HTTP here.

111
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,322
The second header sets up which headers

112
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:08,568
I want to allow on incoming requests.

113
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:09,906
You could leave this out.

114
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:11,930
But, yeah, here I added it.

115
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,863
And the third parameter specifies

116
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,659
which method, which HTTP methods

117
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:18,776
I want to allow.

118
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:20,822
Here, it's POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE,

119
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:21,921
the four methods we will use

120
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,215
throughout this course.

121
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:24,186
And options,

122
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:25,666
since this will be sent automatically

123
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,361
on PATCH and DELETE requests

124
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,795
when sending HX requests.

125
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:33,925
Very importantly, I then need to call next

126
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:36,943
to let the request continue.

127
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,366
I'm not handling the request here.

128
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,046
I'm not sending a response.

129
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,177
I'm only setting some header,

130
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:43,265
so calling next is key

131
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:45,234
so that the request actually has

132
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:47,863
the chance of reaching our routes here

133
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:49,297
in the app/routes variable,

134
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:51,590
which again points to the app.js file

135
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,284
in the routes folder.

136
00:04:53,284 --> 00:04:55,503
That is the basic backend setup

137
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,857
I want to use.

138
00:04:56,857 --> 00:05:00,857
And with that, let's turn to our front end next.
