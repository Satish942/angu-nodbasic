1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,209
<v Instructor>Thusfar, we already started</v>

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:05,954
setting up this workflow.

3
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:08,316
I want to continue with the dev workflow,

4
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:09,674
but then we also need to build

5
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:11,212
our Angular 2 application

6
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:14,867
so that we can actually test this and see something.

7
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:17,871
Now, here in the corrupted config.dev file,

8
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:20,494
I will import webpackMerge

9
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:23,358
to be able to merge the config I'm creating here

10
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:25,380
with the common config.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,553
I don't want to overwrite it.

12
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:29,929
I really want to merge the differences.

13
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,950
Therefore I will import the config configuration here.

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,525
It, of course, lives in this webpack.config.common file.

15
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:40,942
Here I'll add .js to find it.

16
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:45,672
And I will export the merged configuration here

17
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:48,804
So we'll call webpackMerge, which is a function

18
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:51,659
and here I pass the common configuration

19
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,065
and that has an object the things I want to override.

20
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:59,289
I will set up a devtool to get some source maps and so on.

21
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:00,540
And you can learn more about this

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,244
in the official documentation.

23
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:04,744
I'm going to use this one here

24
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,685
and then I will set up the output

25
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:12,175
where I want to store the bundled file.

26
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:14,191
Well, I want to store it

27
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:18,358
in ./public/js/app path here.

28
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,426
Then, the filename shall be bundle.js.

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,727
And I will set up the publicPath

30
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:33,593
to be /js/app.

31
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:37,492
This is important to let webpack know

32
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:40,909
where our bundle, our compiled code lives

33
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:43,743
Because if we use lazy loading

34
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:45,564
where we have multiple chunks,

35
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,861
we not only have one bundle,

36
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:48,618
we also have small other bundles

37
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:50,501
for our lazy-loaded modules,

38
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,533
it needs to know where to find them.

39
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:55,406
But default look at our root folder,

40
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,840
which is the wrong place.

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,963
It has to go to /js/app.

42
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:00,463
This is important.

43
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,845
And then here I will set up the chunkFilename

44
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:09,038
so how it will name such chunks used in lazy-loading.

45
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,871
It should assign a dynamic id, which I do with the id.

46
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:16,396
Woops, these commas should be after the string.

47
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:19,495
Which I do with the id in the square brackets.

48
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:21,328
And then add chunk.js.

49
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:25,127
So, what's wrong here?

50
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:27,949
Yeah, don't need a plus here.

51
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,116
So, like this.

52
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:32,171
This is my development setup.

53
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:34,720
With that, let's now create the Angular 2 application

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,887
so that we can actually see something.
