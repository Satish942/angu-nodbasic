1
00:00:01,612 --> 00:00:03,603
<v ->Let's add such a script therefore.</v>

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,435
I'll add a script named "build" here

3
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:07,346
for the development workflow.

4
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:09,097
And first thing I wanna do here

5
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:10,807
is I want to use "del," this is

6
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:12,955
the command we have available due

7
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:16,947
to this 'del cli' to delete some files.

8
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:20,079
I want to delete all files in the public/js/app folder.

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,667
So basically the old bundle and all

10
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:24,271
the other files related to this.

11
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,438
Next, I wanna run webpack.

12
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:29,558
Pass the config option pointing

13
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:32,692
to webpack.config.dev.js file

14
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:35,255
to use this configuration file.

15
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:36,557
And then I'll add some other options

16
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:39,568
for a nicer output, how it should handle errors,

17
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:42,701
that it should file on errors, and so on.

18
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:45,998
Also very important at the end, dash dash watch.

19
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:48,115
We'll make sure that we add the watch mode

20
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,743
so that this process keeps running

21
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:51,370
and reboots the project whenever

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,380
we change something in a file.

23
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,293
With this set up, let's now test this

24
00:00:56,293 --> 00:00:59,099
npm run build in the console to see if

25
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:00,930
it correctly bundles everything

26
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,874
builds everything gives us a running project.

27
00:01:04,874 --> 00:01:06,462
While we get this warning.

28
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:09,024
So let's fix this warning.

29
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:13,191
In the common config file, I'll add something after module.

30
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:15,982
Some plugins.

31
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:18,503
Here I'll use a plugin webpack ships with,

32
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:20,659
so it can say "new webpack"

33
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:23,742
and now the ContextReplacementPlugin.

34
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,736
Which will fix this error for us.

35
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:29,160
Here I prepared some code.

36
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,254
I'll copy in here and of course you can find

37
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:35,545
this attached to this lecture.

38
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,377
And with this, let's try it again

39
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:40,226
and let's run npm run build again.

40
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,866
Now we don't have the error anymore.

41
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:47,337
If we had npm start now and reload the application,

42
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,655
it's still not working though.

43
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:52,543
And I found the reason why it doesn't work.

44
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:54,090
Let's quit both processes;

45
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,673
build process answer over here.

46
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:01,820
The problem is here in my app component.

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,517
I forgot the relative pathway importing the css file.

48
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:07,757
Therefore it doesn't find it on run time.

49
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:09,993
And the error has went out of source

50
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,189
in the common config file.

51
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,645
Yeah, this is not the right regular expression.

52
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:17,273
Now it's the right expression.

53
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:18,737
So restarting process again

54
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:21,219
now I need to because I changed the config file.

55
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,050
And now I'm confident that we're able

56
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,181
to load this css file correctly.

57
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,580
So if I now head over one final time

58
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,961
I reload we see 'Hello World!'

59
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:31,997
in red, so this is for working

60
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:36,308
and this developmental process is therefore finished.

61
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:38,506
Now the next videos, I will take care

62
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:40,625
of our de production workflow using

63
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,708
ahead of time so offline compilation.
