00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:03,688
<v ->The first thing I did was I created</v>

2
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:07,076
a normal node express application,

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:09,776
and for that I used express generator.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,399
Which you can find some instructions

5
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:14,290
on at expressjs.com and simply Google for

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,900
express generator, you will find this page.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,062
This is a little tool which scaffolds out

8
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:23,554
a basic express, node express project,

9
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:26,059
and I'm using this to build up on it

10
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,002
and adjust it to my needs.

11
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:29,741
So you can basically follow these steps

12
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:31,191
on this page and first run

13
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:34,214
npm instal express-generator -G

14
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:36,871
to globally instal this express generator

15
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,627
on your machine.

16
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:40,923
And once you have done so, switch into the folder

17
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:42,891
where you want to create your project.

18
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:44,320
I'm in an empty folder here.

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,497
And then run express dot if you want to

20
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:49,905
use this folder, otherwise the name of the folder

21
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:52,559
you want to create for this project.

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,981
And then, minus minus hps here because

23
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,418
I want to set up hps handlebars as

24
00:00:58,418 --> 00:01:00,443
the default view engine.

25
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:01,693
Now I'm getting a warning here because

26
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:04,902
I got some idIDEfiles in this folder already,

27
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:06,504
but with that it scaffolded out

28
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:09,139
this project folder or setup and you might

29
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:11,844
already recognise this from earlier.

30
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:15,615
It's really close to what you saw before.

31
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:17,281
Now in this project, the first thing

32
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,922
you gotta do is to navigate inside of it

33
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:21,983
to in the terminal, run nmp instal

34
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:23,964
because this didn't instal the dependencies,

35
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,556
it only gave us a package to chase

36
00:01:25,556 --> 00:01:27,687
and follow with some basic dependencies

37
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,714
node and express need to work correctly.

38
00:01:30,714 --> 00:01:33,033
After doing so, you may run npm start.

39
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,736
This script is also already set up,

40
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:37,184
which allows you to start this application.

41
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:39,800
And then you can already head over and view it

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,300
at localhost:3000.

43
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:45,833
That's all, this is how the node express app got started.

44
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,465
Of course there's no Angular part in there yet,

45
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,777
but we at least have the back end.

46
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,973
Though, I will fine-tune this a little bit too.

47
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:56,056
And I will work on the back end next.
