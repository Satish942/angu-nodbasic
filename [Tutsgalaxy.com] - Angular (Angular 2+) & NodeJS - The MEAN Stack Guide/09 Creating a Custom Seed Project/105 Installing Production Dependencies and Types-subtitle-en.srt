00:00:01,832 --> 00:00:05,336
<v Instructor>Let's start pulling in Angular 2.</v>

2
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:09,503
Here to the dependencies I'll add the Angular 2 package.

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,132
You may, of course, choose the latest version

4
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:16,041
at the point of time you're watching this video.

5
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,373
This is Angular 2, it's just split up

6
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:20,477
over multiple packages because we can

7
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:22,936
then pull in only the parts we need and so on.

8
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:26,638
So these are the Angular 2 specific dependencies,

9
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:29,540
but Angular 2 also needs polyfills and so on

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,902
to work correctly.

11
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:32,957
So I will add these polyfills too.

12
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:34,944
I exit out of my server here

13
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:37,412
so that I can instal some stuff again.

14
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,495
And I want to instal, as a production dependency

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,207
with --save zone.js.

16
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,814
I also want to instal rxjs.

17
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:53,494
I also want to instal core-js.

18
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,831
And that is it.

19
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:58,633
These are the three dependencies I need to instal

20
00:00:58,633 --> 00:01:02,912
to have my application work correctly here.

21
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,324
Now with that being pulled down,

22
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:05,849
it will add to dependencies here

23
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,932
to the dependencies node,

24
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,576
and with that we've got everything we need

25
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:11,982
to run Angular 2.

26
00:01:11,982 --> 00:01:13,642
I will later on add some dependencies

27
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:16,709
to set up my build process though.

28
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,497
Now with that added, we can soon start

29
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,816
working on the front end application.

30
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:23,625
What I will add first are some types.

31
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,637
Types are basically the bridge between

32
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:27,313
shallow script libraries

33
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:29,168
and type script code.

34
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:32,526
Angular 2 is written in type script word,

35
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,973
using type script,

36
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:36,488
but we're also using some commands

37
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:38,343
from Shallow Script libraries,

38
00:01:38,343 --> 00:01:40,141
like from core-js.

39
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,471
So I need to instal these types

40
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:45,560
to have that bridge so that my Angular 2 code

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,461
correctly uses these Shallow Script packages

42
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:50,665
so to say.

43
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:53,489
I can instal ,

44
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,070
<v ->-save-dev as these types are development</v>

45
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,721
dependencies, not required when deploying our

46
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:02,982
application, and here I want to instal

47
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:07,149
@types/node and @types/core-js.

48
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,850
Now since this probably looks strange,

49
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,717
I'm not installing the node types

50
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,786
because we would write node-js in

51
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:16,845
type script code.

52
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,309
We don't in this course.

53
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:22,411
I instal them, because in our front end,

54
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,292
processing our front end code,

55
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:28,080
we will use some node-js specific commands

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,290
or features and for this to work correctly,

57
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,162
we can do so because no js is installed of course.

58
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:35,930
But for this to work correctly without

59
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,268
any compilation errors, we need to make

60
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:41,129
types aware of it, and we do this by installing

61
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,712
these types.

62
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:45,265
So I can now hit enter to also instal these types

63
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,060
and add them as development dependencies here.

64
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,185
And with that I'd say let's start working

65
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:53,185
on our front end build process next.
