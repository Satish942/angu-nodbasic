<v ->Throughout this course and the project,</v>

2
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:04,484
we both, throughout this course,

3
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:07,456
we used a seed project I supplied to you.

4
00:00:07,456 --> 00:00:10,624
Now maybe you're interested in how this project was set up,

5
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:12,977
and how you may set up your own project,

6
00:00:12,977 --> 00:00:15,461
or built up on this project, and extend it,

7
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:17,209
change it to your needs.

8
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:18,982
Therefore, in this module I will show you

9
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:21,761
how I created the seed project for this course,

10
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:24,891
and how I set up the boat proses we used here.

11
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,141
So let's start.
