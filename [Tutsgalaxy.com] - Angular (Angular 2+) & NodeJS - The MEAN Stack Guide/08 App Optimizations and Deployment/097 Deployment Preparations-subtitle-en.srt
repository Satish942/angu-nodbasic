1
00:00:01,647 --> 00:00:03,914
<v ->In the next videos I will deploy the application</v>

2
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:06,351
we built with offline compilations.

3
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:09,641
So, whenever you see me rebuild the application

4
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:12,568
I use the command NPM run build production.

5
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:15,073
This has changed since I recorded the videos,

6
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:19,231
now simply NPM run build:prod like this.

7
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:22,352
So not production, just prod.

8
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:25,041
Besides that, all the other steps you see

9
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,849
should be the very same.

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,878
The messages you see here are changed a little bit,

11
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:30,879
and the folder structure on the left,

12
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,371
since I'm now using you built process,

13
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:34,646
but generally it's the same.

14
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:38,622
Also my assertion about which files to deploy is the same.

15
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:42,150
You need to deploy all the folders

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,043
you see here, including app js.

17
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,772
This file, not the assets folder.

18
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:49,027
Especially of course make sure

19
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:52,133
that you've got your bundled application here,

20
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:54,821
which should be done automatically though

21
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,259
when you run NPM run build:prod.

22
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,981
Also important, you don't need to import

23
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:02,475
enableProdMode anymore.

24
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:05,659
It's already done here in the MainAOT.ts,

25
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,393
which happens to be the file being used

26
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:09,060
when we run NPM build:prod.

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,816
So this will be enabled by default.

28
00:01:11,816 --> 00:01:13,485
With that I wish you fun with the next videos

29
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:16,902
where we actually deploy our application.
