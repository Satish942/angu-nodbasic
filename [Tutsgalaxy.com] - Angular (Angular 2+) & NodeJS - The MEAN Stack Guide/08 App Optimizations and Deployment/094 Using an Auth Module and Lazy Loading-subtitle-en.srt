00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:02,812
<v ->Now, the last lecture,</v>

2
00:00:02,812 --> 00:00:05,407
we created this message module to outsource

3
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:07,756
our message-related parts or code,

4
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:10,303
components in that module.

5
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:12,774
It makes our app module file leaner,

6
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:15,842
but, besides that, there aren't that many advantages

7
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:17,378
because we still import it.

8
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:19,202
So, it is a good approach.

9
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:21,427
It makes this file a bit easier to read,

10
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:23,898
but, performancewise, we don't gain anything.

11
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,436
This will change with the auth module, though.

12
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:29,476
The auth module is loaded via routing.

13
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:31,161
So is the message module,

14
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:33,166
but we always load the messages here

15
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,129
since we redirect to them, right?

16
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,645
But, for the auth module, we don't do that.

17
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:39,163
So, it would make sense

18
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:43,716
to only load the authentication parts if we need them.

19
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:47,883
So, for that, let's create a new module in the auth folder,

20
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,797
auth module ts,

21
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:55,036
and, as before, I will simply export

22
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:57,458
a class named AuthModule here,

23
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,208
and I will attach NgModule to it,

24
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,003
this NgModule decorator, which of course,

25
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:07,170
I need to import from at angular core.

26
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:16,322
With that imported, we can now add components

27
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:19,614
we only use in the auth part.

28
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:20,894
Let's head over the app module

29
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:22,874
and see what we can strip out.

30
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,471
Well, we could remove these Signin, Signup

31
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:27,029
and Logout components.

32
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:29,162
These are only used in the auth section,

33
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:30,971
and you might think that you can also remove

34
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:32,653
the authentication component.

35
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:34,406
This is not true, though.

36
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:37,085
We do use it in the routing here,

37
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:40,652
and while I will change the way we load our routes soon,

38
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:43,115
we still need to declare it.

39
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:45,914
We didn't need to do this for the messages component before

40
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:48,352
because we import the message module

41
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:50,338
right away at the beginning here,

42
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:51,894
when we start our app.

43
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,903
So, the message module, and therefore, the message component

44
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:57,091
is available to our root router.

45
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:00,263
Now, for the authentication component and the auth part,

46
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:02,657
I want to lazily load this module, which means

47
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,577
I want to only load it once we need it.

48
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:07,892
The authentication components here, though,

49
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:09,045
is needed all the time

50
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,639
because it's part of our root routes.

51
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,443
Therefore, we can't remove

52
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:15,350
the authentication component here.

53
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,670
What we can remove, though, are the ReactiveFormsModules

54
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,742
or this ReactiveFormsModule here

55
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:22,871
because this is not needed.

56
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:26,340
We will import this in the auth module,

57
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,913
where we use the reactive forms

58
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:30,947
to submit our Signup and Signin forms.

59
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:33,303
The AuthService definitely has to say here

60
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:34,959
because we use it application-wide,

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,165
so we'll let it stay in the app module.

62
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:42,398
With that, I can head over to the auth module

63
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:45,648
and add the Signin, SignUp

64
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:50,746
and Logout components here.

65
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:54,698
And, of course, we also need to import some things.

66
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:57,909
For example, the CommonModule and then

67
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:59,151
the ReactiveFormsModule.

68
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:02,984
I'll add the imports app here first.

69
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:07,231
At angular common, we add the CommonModule,

70
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:11,998
and from at angular forms,

71
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:14,598
we add the ReactiveFormsModule.

72
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:17,129
So, let's also add them here to the imports,

73
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,093
and then, that's it!

74
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:19,722
This is my app module.

75
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:21,911
Now, as I said, I want to lazily load it,

76
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,576
and, therefore, I need to change

77
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:25,290
the way we load the routes.

78
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,561
Right now, we load them right at the beginning.

79
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:29,888
Here, in the app routing file,

80
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:32,530
we import this auth routes constant,

81
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,820
which is set up in the auth routes file,

82
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,590
and here, we load all these components,

83
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,955
so that's no lazy load at all.

84
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:41,560
In order to change this, I need to set up

85
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,977
my own router module in this auth module.

86
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:49,824
I'll first rename this file to auth routing

87
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:52,355
to be in line with the app routing file

88
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,638
from a naming perspective.

89
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:58,033
Then, I will no longer export this constant here.

90
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:01,372
Instead, I want to export a new constant,

91
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:03,788
which I'll name authRouting,

92
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:06,204
which uses the RouterModule.

93
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,378
I have to import it from at angular router.

94
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:13,224
And then, the forChild method.

95
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:16,218
In the app routing file, we use forRoot

96
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:19,960
to restructure some route routes for the whole application.

97
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,261
Now, in the auth routing file here,

98
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:25,002
I want restructure some routes,

99
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,214
which are only valid for this auth section,

100
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:29,046
which is why I use forChild.

101
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:30,928
It's only a part of the application,

102
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:33,042
not the entire application.

103
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:36,182
And here, I pass by auth routes as an argument.

104
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:37,708
This, of course, means that

105
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,080
I now need to adjust my routing file.

106
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,919
First of all, I can remove this import,

107
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,280
it doesn't work any more.

108
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,210
And, second, this part here has to change.

109
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,858
Instead of directly importing children like this,

110
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:53,380
I now use loadChildren,

111
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,411
and this key tells Angular 2 to lazy load them.

112
00:04:57,411 --> 00:05:00,725
Here, I therefore pass a string as a value,

113
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:03,136
and this is important, a string, not a type.

114
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,944
I don't import the auth routing.

115
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:08,602
Router here does RouterModule I created there,

116
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,825
that would, indeed, load them instantly again.

117
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:14,243
Instead, here, I create a string,

118
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:17,612
where I point to this module I want to load.

119
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:21,171
Now, that is, seen from this app routing file on,

120
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,974
in the slash auth folder,

121
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:25,167
and here in the auth dot module file

122
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,938
without the extension.

123
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:29,725
I also need to specify the name of the class

124
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,104
I want to import.

125
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:34,211
This is, of course, AuthModule.

126
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,570
So, therefore, here, I separate it with a hashtag

127
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,249
and then AuthModule.

128
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,938
I added a package to my webpack work flow,

129
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:45,812
which converts the string in, actually, a function,

130
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,251
which Angular 2 can use at run time

131
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:51,733
to dynamically load this module when it needs it.

132
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,967
Now, since I point to the module here,

133
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:57,440
and we created the RouterModule in the auth routing file,

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,614
we now need to import this auth routing file

135
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:04,827
or this authRouting router module in the auth module here.

136
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:07,693
So make sure to add this import, auth the router,

137
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:10,060
the router we just created.

138
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,571
With that, if we save all that,

139
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:16,961
and we let it recompile, it should work,

140
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,373
and if we now reload the application,

141
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:21,550
we see, it works.

142
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,115
The interesting part is,

143
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,909
if you open up the developer tools

144
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:29,384
and go to the Network tab, disable cache here,

145
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:33,117
and then reload the app on the messages route here.

146
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:35,134
You'll see a couple of files get downloaded

147
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,435
among them, the bundle.

148
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:37,654
No worries, it's that large

149
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:39,655
because we're in development mode.

150
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:41,432
If I now click on Authentication,

151
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,416
watch this part down here,

152
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:47,976
where we see Network, incoming network responses.

153
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:51,683
You see that, we downloaded this chunk js file,

154
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:53,203
and this is just lazy loading.

155
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:55,215
It only downloaded this file,

156
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:59,303
which keeps the code responsible for what we see here

157
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:00,464
and what we use here.

158
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:03,639
It downloaded this file here

159
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,192
right here when we needed it,

160
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,717
when I clicked on Authentication

161
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,271
and not before doing so.

162
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,854
This is lazy loading in action.
