1
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:03,835
<v ->The first thing I want to do is,</v>

2
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:06,351
I will outsource my MongoDB.

3
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:09,813
Now of course, you can instal your own MongoDB server,

4
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:13,446
on, for example, an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services,

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,630
but that really would be beyond the scope of this course.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,482
This is no AWS course, right?

7
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:21,516
And the great thing is we have certain providers

8
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:23,722
where we can easily outsource this.

9
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:26,125
Specifically I'm talking about MongoLab.

10
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:30,945
So just search for MongoLab and you'll find mlab.com.

11
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:33,876
This is a provider where you can host your own

12
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:37,379
MongoDB databases or actually, it's hosted on other services

13
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:39,956
but they set it up for you and you can conveniently

14
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,023
manage it and access it.

15
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:45,843
Generally, there is a free plan, the sandbox account,

16
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:49,850
but for production usage, it probably will cost something.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,746
So check out their plans and features,

18
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:54,189
and make sure you're not paying for something

19
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,393
you don't want or you're not paying too much.

20
00:00:56,393 --> 00:00:58,955
I'll, for this video, use the sandbox account,

21
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:00,116
which is free.

22
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:02,709
So sign up if you haven't already,

23
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:06,501
and I will just log in since I already have an account.

24
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,666
I will see you once I'm done.

25
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,914
Once signed up, you should be in this dashboard here,

26
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:15,929
and there you can create a new Mongo database.

27
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:18,236
So click on this, and this might take a couple of seconds

28
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:19,345
to load.

29
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:23,726
Once it has loaded, you can choose which cloud provider

30
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:26,076
should actually host the database,

31
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:28,227
and you may choose whatever you like.

32
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:30,068
I'm going with AWS here.

33
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:34,235
And since I'm in Germany, I'll just pick the EU region here,

34
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:38,691
but choose whatever region suits your needs.

35
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:41,503
And then click on Single-node.

36
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:43,271
And here on Sandbox.

37
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:48,240
Now as I said, this is a free testing environment mainly,

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,957
but as you can see, there are of course, also paid plans

39
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:52,207
for your needs.

40
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:54,969
So I'll choose the sandbox,

41
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:57,896
and just make sure that here at the bottom you see this

42
00:01:57,896 --> 00:02:01,576
zero dollars per month thing, or well,

43
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:03,861
whatever you want to pay, but make sure you're not paying

44
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:05,394
for something you don't want.

45
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:07,706
You should then give this database a name.

46
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:10,157
I'll name mine angular2-deployment.

47
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:13,254
And then you can create this new MongoDB deployment,

48
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:15,683
which will also take a couple of seconds.

49
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:17,670
Now as you can see it's now in progress,

50
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,641
and being prepared, and now it's done.

51
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,478
Once it's done, click on it.

52
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:25,406
And on this page, click on users.

53
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,983
Now here, you wanna create a new database user.

54
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:31,040
Pick whichever name suits your needs.

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,440
I'll name mine test-user,

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,690
and just give it a password of test_pw.

57
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,865
Of course, maybe you want to pick a more secure one

58
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:43,838
for real production or when you're actually putting

59
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:46,782
a real app into production.

60
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:50,847
So with this user setup, I'm pretty much done.

61
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:52,954
The next step is to copy this link here,

62
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:55,161
without the mongodb at the beginning,

63
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:57,591
and go back to your application.

64
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,726
Now that's the link you will have to enter into

65
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:03,882
the app.js file here, when connecting to MongoDB

66
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,253
with Mongoose.

67
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,101
Currently we're connecting with localhost,

68
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:09,402
and of course, that won't work when we're running this

69
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,124
on a real server.

70
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,981
So I'm going to replace this with the link I just copied,

71
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:17,541
and here, for dbuser, I enter test-user,

72
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,258
which is the user I just created,

73
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:23,169
and then test_pw, which is the password I just created.

74
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,186
Now as a side note, hard coding it like this will work,

75
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:30,427
but you probably might choose other methods,

76
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:33,655
like setting an environment variable with these fields,

77
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:36,756
which then are accessed through your code

78
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:40,715
to make this a little bit more secure and also configurable.

79
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:43,714
For here, I'll go with the hard coding approach.

80
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:46,441
So with that, I'm connecting to this database.

81
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:50,608
The next step is to actually deploy the application.
