1
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:02,821
<v ->I want to start with Heroku,</v>

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:05,071
so I'll head over to Heroku

3
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:08,720
.com,

4
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:12,801
and then either create an account

5
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:15,593
or if you already have one, just log in of course.

6
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:18,388
So I'll quickly do that.

7
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:21,758
On your dashboard, click create new app,

8
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:23,656
and then choose whichever name you want,

9
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:27,281
angular2-deployment in my case here which is available.

10
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,226
Runtime, I'll choose Europe here,

11
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:31,574
and then I'll create the application.

12
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:34,831
Now I don't have to specify which kind of app this is,

13
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,552
if it's Node.js or PHP,

14
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:39,163
since Heroku will automatically detect this,

15
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:42,921
or I could set it in some kind of off environment variables,

16
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,271
but I'll go with the automatic detection.

17
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,735
Now as you can see, you got various options of deploying.

18
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:51,291
You could just use Dropbox to sync it,

19
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,877
but I'll use Heroku Git, and of course for this,

20
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:56,130
you will need Git on your computer.

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,345
If you're not aware what Git is or you don't have it,

22
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:02,279
I strongly recommend googling it and looking it up.

23
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:05,136
And basically it's a version control system

24
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:07,214
which basically allows you to keep different versions

25
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:08,706
of your source code.

26
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:11,129
And you want to make sure that this is installed

27
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:12,762
for this to work.

28
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:15,327
So with the Heroku Git approach,

29
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:18,416
you have to instal the Heroku Toolbelt here,

30
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,534
so make sure you're doing this,

31
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:22,981
just download it here and follow the instructions

32
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,064
you see here.

33
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,951
And once this is done, you get a new command

34
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:32,919
you can use in your terminal or command line window.

35
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:35,208
So I'm going to do this.

36
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:39,264
Back in my project, I'll open up my terminal here.

37
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:40,530
Let me clear this.

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,461
And first I have to log in, so I'm quickly doing that.

39
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:46,231
Once you're successfully logged in,

40
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,497
you see on the Heroku page that the next step is

41
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:51,237
to put your project under a Git's version control.

42
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,787
I already did this.

43
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:54,924
And then you have to run this command here

44
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:58,757
to basically add Heroku as a remote repository

45
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:04,320
for your project where you can stores your files then.

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,653
So I'll do that.

47
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,057
The next step is to stage all your files

48
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:11,347
which means make them ready to be committed

49
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:15,731
to your Git repository and then actually commit them.

50
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:18,259
But before I do this, I have to make some changes.

51
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:21,125
Remember that in the Angular 2 code,

52
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,398
I'm still using these references

53
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:25,923
to my local host server here.

54
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:30,601
I have to exchange this with the link to Heroku.

55
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:34,165
So in order to do this, I'll go to settings here,

56
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:36,915
and here you can find your domain

57
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:40,871
where you'll find your application once it's running.

58
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:45,251
So copy this link and then over in the service,

59
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:49,319
I'm just going to replace all my localhost:3000

60
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,853
links here or addresses with this new address.

61
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,967
Now would it be better to store this in one central variable

62
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,671
which I could just change and have it change everywhere?

63
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:02,552
It definitely would, but I will just go with this

64
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:05,291
as I don't want to make this about refactoring here,

65
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,997
but it's certainly a good idea to do that.

66
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:11,797
I'll also do the same in the off service of course

67
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:14,134
so that everywhere we're connecting

68
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:18,496
to the Heroku server and not to local host anymore.

69
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:20,523
Now with that being done, I can head back

70
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:23,756
to the deploy page here and follow along.

71
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:27,622
So the next step is I'll add type git add .

72
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,496
to stage all files.

73
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:31,476
And then I can commit them with a message

74
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,643
like ready for deployment.

75
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:40,546
This commits my files, however this is not exactly

76
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:41,808
what I need to do.

77
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:44,502
I need to do one extra step.

78
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:48,730
I also have to make the production ready,

79
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,758
so I will run npm run build:production

80
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:55,758
which is the script setup in the workflow module

81
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,645
which will prepare my app for production

82
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:01,629
which will bundle everything and so on

83
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:04,065
because I don't need to commit my TypeScript files here.

84
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:05,073
Remember that.

85
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:08,406
I need to commit and provide my finished

86
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,643
app here in the Chalice script folder

87
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:14,535
so that is what I just did.

88
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:16,395
I bundled everything and prepared it.

89
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:18,999
Now I can again add everything,

90
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:22,332
and now I'm really ready for deployment.

91
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:28,791
So now that this is committed,

92
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:32,958
I can continue with the next step, to push it to Heroku

93
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:36,099
with this command.

94
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,334
But since I'm on a different branch here

95
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,642
and this might not be the case on your project,

96
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:43,062
but I have different branches for different steps

97
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,062
in this overall project.

98
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:48,911
I have to change this a little bit,

99
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:51,411
and I will actually push from,

100
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,933
I conveniently named ron-cheer.

101
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:01,020
So I'll run this.

102
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:06,480
And now you can see it's uploading it here,

103
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:09,651
writing all these objects.

104
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:13,453
Now it's uploaded and then you should soon see

105
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:14,703
Heroku kick in.

106
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,325
Yeah, here you go.

107
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,875
It detected a Node.js application,

108
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,684
and now it's installing all the node modules detected

109
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:25,920
in the package.json.

110
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,914
And we'll wait for this to finish.

111
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:31,257
I'll be back once it's done.

112
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:32,090
So it's done.

113
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,884
It successfully launched and you shouldn't see

114
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:34,760
an error here.

115
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,425
Here is the link where you will find your application.

116
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,350
So let's see if this works.

117
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,578
The title at least works.

118
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:44,245
This looks pretty good.

119
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:47,995
So if we now sign up here, create a new user.

120
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:50,995
Test, test, sign up.

121
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:54,006
You see that it doesn't seem to run,

122
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:55,551
and if we have a look at the console

123
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:59,556
we see that we get this error that we got mixed content.

124
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:03,556
We loaded this page over HTTPS, so as using SSL,

125
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:09,145
but we are requesting now with the Angular 2 services

126
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:12,317
a resource on HHTP without SSL.

127
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:16,484
That won't work, so I'll go back to my application.

128
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:19,125
Shrink this a bit.

129
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,439
And in my services here, I have to make

130
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,939
all these calls using HTTPS, so using SSL.

131
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:32,153
So we'll just add an S for HHTP here in all these links.

132
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:34,399
Now with this, I'll just repeat the last steps.

133
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,327
I'll build it again,

134
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:40,324
then I will add everything or stage everything

135
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:41,924
for committing,

136
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:45,936
then I will commit it, and then I can push it again.

137
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:49,046
And the cool thing about Heroku is now I'm pushing it again

138
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:52,916
and it will automatically restart this app then,

139
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,673
or it will detect this and everything will work like this.

140
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:59,044
I don't have to delete the old app first.

141
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,820
It will just work like that.

142
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,694
As you see it was done pretty fast

143
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,471
as it didn't reinstall everything,

144
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,895
it just detected your changes.

145
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:08,323
And now it's working again,

146
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:12,490
so let's first navigate back to the root of our application.

147
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:19,592
It might take a couple of seconds here, but now it is done.

148
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:23,509
And now if I click signup and I try this again.

149
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:31,003
Let's see if this worked by logging in here.

150
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:32,929
No thank you.

151
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:35,153
That looks good, and if I add a message,

152
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:36,466
we see it here.

153
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:38,048
Now let's see if this message stays here

154
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:39,314
if I reload the application,

155
00:07:39,314 --> 00:07:41,420
if it really was stored on the server.

156
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,656
Looks great, so let's edit it.

157
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:45,035
Save this.

158
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:47,170
Go back to authentication, go back here,

159
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,407
reload the application.

160
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:51,063
Well that looks all very great,

161
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:53,224
and as you can see with these easy steps,

162
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:55,908
