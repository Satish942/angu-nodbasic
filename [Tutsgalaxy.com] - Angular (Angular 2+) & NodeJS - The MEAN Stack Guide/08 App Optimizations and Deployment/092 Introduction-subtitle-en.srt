1
00:00:01,337 --> 00:00:04,238
<v ->That was the application as we know it, as we built it.</v>

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,457
It works fine, there's nothing wrong with it,

3
00:00:06,457 --> 00:00:10,359
but if we have a look at it here in the folder structure

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,655
we recognise that we get this auth

5
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:14,335
and this messages feature.

6
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:17,229
Angular2 has this concept called modules.

7
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:19,080
We have this App module here,

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,951
and we can use this module concept

9
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:25,672
to outsource the messages and the auth related parts

10
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,439
into different components.

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,221
Since we load the authentication part

12
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:32,352
when going to auth here,

13
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:34,587
which isn't the default, the default is messages.

14
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:36,986
We can also think about lazy loading this

15
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:39,753
so that it only gets loaded if we actually go there.

16
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:42,543
In the end of the section I wanna compile

17
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,658
this all using offline compilation.

18
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:46,325
You'll learn how to set this up in

19
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:48,564
the project module in this course.

20
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:52,637
Then we should be prepared to deploy this application.

21
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:56,052
Well, let's start with the messages module

22
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:58,921
and outsource this, or build it in its own module,

23
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,421
in the next video.
