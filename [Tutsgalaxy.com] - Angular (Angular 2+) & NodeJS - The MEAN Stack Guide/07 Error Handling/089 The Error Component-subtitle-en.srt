1
00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:03,629
<v Instructor>Let's create this modal</v>

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,165
I want to show in case of an error.

3
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:09,395
Here in my component.ts file,

4
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:12,978
I will export a class named ErrorComponent.

5
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:17,315
Now this class here, of course, needs to get

6
00:00:17,315 --> 00:00:21,482
the ComponentDecorator imported from @angular/core.

7
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:25,816
Now how should this look like?

8
00:00:25,816 --> 00:00:29,568
It needs a selector, I'll name it app-error.

9
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:32,648
You, of course, can choose any selector you want.

10
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,446
It also needs a template,

11
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:37,060
and I will create a new file for this:

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,477
the error.component.html file

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,695
to outsource this template.

14
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:44,833
So let's reference this template here

15
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,666
by adding templateUrl,

16
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:49,398
which should point

17
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:52,981
to the error.component.html file like this.

18
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:56,933
Now how should the component

19
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:59,600
or the html code here look like?

20
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:04,363
Well, I need a backdrop in the back

21
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:07,573
which greys out the background, and then the actual modal,

22
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:10,552
and I will use the Bootstrap modal for this.

23
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:13,632
Now you can basically just copy that code

24
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:17,083
from the Bootstrap webpage, so let's head over

25
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,923
to getbootstrap.com, and under JavaScript here,

26
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:22,893
you will find the modal.

27
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:26,173
Now we won't use the JavaScript Bootstrap offers us,

28
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:30,292
I'm only interested in the HTML and CSS code here.

29
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,403
We will hook up the rest on our own.

30
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:34,755
So let's copy this in here.

31
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:37,005
This generally is all fine.

32
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:40,965
Though, I also need to add the backdrop,

33
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:43,835
so let's add a class named backdrop.

34
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:46,093
I will create this class on my own.

35
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:47,835
It's not a Bootstrap class.

36
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:50,595
This is the backdrop I conditionally want to show or hide,

37
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:54,413
as well as the modal, so that the background is grey.

38
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,984
Now this setup here is fine for now.

39
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:01,493
I will, of course, remove these data-dismiss things

40
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:04,544
because I won't let Bootstrap handle this.

41
00:02:04,544 --> 00:02:07,045
I don't even have the Bootstrap JavaScript code

42
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,793
to handle this, so I will need to add

43
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:12,024
my own on-click listeners here.

44
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,622
And now let's think about

45
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:17,603
which data I want to output in this modal.

46
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:20,173
And I also want to delete the save changes button.

47
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,373
There are no changes to be saved.

48
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:25,933
But this is the general setup of this modal.

49
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,923
The two things I want to do now is,

50
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:30,032
I want to configure my own backdrop,

51
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:32,123
this custom class here, and then I want

52
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:34,523
to output some data here, which of course,

53
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:38,690
first I need to create as a property in my TypeScript file.

54
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,892
So let's do this here.

55
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:45,952
I will create a new property named error,

56
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:48,480
which is of type error, so my error

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,291
I created here from the error.model file.

58
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,671
This initially is undefined.

59
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,901
I also will setup another property,

60
00:02:56,901 --> 00:03:01,181
which decides on whether this should be displayed or not.

61
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,203
So I will name it displayed, and set it

62
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:07,741
to a string named none, or the value of none.

63
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:11,061
I will then use this with the ng-style directive later on

64
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:13,590
to change the display of the modal

65
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,030
from block to none, and the other way around.

66
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,197
So now this gives me these two valuable properties.

67
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:26,051
As I just said, I also need to define the styles.

68
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:30,814
I could outsource them, but I will write them inline here

69
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:32,799
with back ticks,

70
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,389
I can write a multi-line string here, of course,

71
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,619
and then I already prepared this class,

72
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,131
which I'm copying in here.

73
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:45,259
So this class simply gives it a nice grey background,

74
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:48,811
a bit transparent, and then fixed position

75
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:53,099
and spans it over the full window width and height.

76
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,932
This will be the modal background.

77
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,579
With this setup here, we're not yet getting the error,

78
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:03,029
but we're able to finish this component.

79
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,131
We've got the style of the backdrop,

80
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:07,520
and we've got the displayed property,

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,909
which we can use together with ng-style

82
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:12,899
to change the display style of the modal,

83
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:15,579
and the error to output data.

84
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,821
So back in the html code, let's use this.

85
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:22,341
First, here on the backdrop,

86
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:26,508
I will add the ng-style directive with property binding,

87
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:28,691
like this.

88
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:34,477
And here, the style I want to change is display.

89
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:38,618
This is a normal CSS style, of course,

90
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:42,072
and I want to set it to display.

91
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,359
And let's change this property name to display

92
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:47,925
to be in line here, so to display.

93
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:51,835
I can now copy this and also add this to my modal,

94
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:56,024
which I also only want to show while it should be shown.

95
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:57,773
And with that in place,

96
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:00,654
I can now output the error title here

97
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:03,466
and the modal title with string interpolation.

98
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:06,554
So let's access error, and then ?.title

99
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:09,056
because I don't know if the error is set.

100
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:11,296
It is undefined at the beginning.

101
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:13,896
And since I will place this modal

102
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,736
in my code right from the start,

103
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:20,117
because remember I'm not attaching or detaching it

104
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:23,546
with ng-if, I'm showing or hiding it with ng-style,

105
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:25,357
so it will always be there.

106
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:27,986
Since this is the case, I need this question mark

107
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:30,506
because we might simply not have gotten an error yet,

108
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:32,997
in which case, I certainly want to get an error

109
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:35,986
from the error model because we don't have an error,

110
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,296
that is really kind of stupid.

111
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:42,225
So this the error title, and then here in the body,

112
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:45,296
of course, I want to output the error message

113
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:49,463
also with a question mark to avoid any nasty errors.

114
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:53,537
The last thing I want to configure here

115
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,901
is this close button,

116
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,411
so either the X, if that has been clicked,

117
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:00,325
or the close button itself.

118
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:04,896
Here I'll have a click-listener and execute onErrorHandled,

119
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,677
a method I have yet to create.

120
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:11,256
So let me copy it here and also add it to this button.

121
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:14,356
This sets up the template of my modal.

122
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:17,014
The last step for me is to,

123
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:19,113
for now, to add this

124
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,363
onErrorHandled method here,

125
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,358
and in here,

126
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:28,907
I simply want to switch display back to none.

127
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:31,907
We don't have code to switch to anything else right now.

128
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:34,587
This will follow soon, but with this I make sure

129
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:37,747
that the modal disappears once we close it.

130
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:40,078
Now to prepare this for usage,

131
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:42,266
I will add it to my app component,

132
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,867
because again, I will always have it here.

133
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,358
I will always have my error component around,

134
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:49,918
I just switch its display style.

135
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,867
So I will append it here:

136
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:56,718
app-error is the selector of my error component here,

137
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:59,257
and for this to work, I also need to add it

138
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:02,340
to my app module, the ErrorComponent.

139
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,078
Also make sure to add the import up here.

140
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:11,726
With this setup, the error component is added.

141
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:14,643
If I save it and recompile my code,

142
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:20,566
we can see this kind of, if I reload the application.

143
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:24,483
We can see it if we inspect the HTML code here,

144
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:29,137
that at the very end we get this app-error element,

145
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,926
though of course, we don't see it

146
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:33,177
because the display is set to none.

147
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:35,617
I can switch this to block though,

148
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:38,387
so now we see the backdrop, at least.

149
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:41,017
But this is not really how it should work, right?

150
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:44,318
So let's make sure to setup the error service next,

151
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:48,485
so that we're actually able to emit errors and handle them.
