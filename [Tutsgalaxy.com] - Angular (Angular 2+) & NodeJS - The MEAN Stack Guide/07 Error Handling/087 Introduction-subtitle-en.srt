1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:04,322
<v ->I do like the state of our application</v>

2
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:06,570
but there's one thing I don't like.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,620
If I'm not logged in and I try to save a message

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,620
I do get the error here, which is correct,

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,713
I am not logged in.

6
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,587
I'm not authorised to do this.

7
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:16,704
But it would be nice to get like a model here

8
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:18,701
which basically tells me the same thing

9
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:21,854
but in a nicer way, so that I don't have to check

10
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:25,960
the console which users of the website typically don't do.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,557
While the same is true for other parts

12
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:29,195
of this application here,

13
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,336
let's say that we wanna sign up here

14
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:34,330
with an e-mail address which was already used.

15
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,325
Well, in this case, it would be nice to also get

16
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:40,762
an error in form of a model and not just this error

17
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:42,068
here on the right.

18
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:43,987
So these are just some improvements I want to do.

19
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:46,948
I want to handle these errors in a better way.

20
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:49,586
So in this module, we'll implement a better way

21
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:51,669
of handling these errors.
