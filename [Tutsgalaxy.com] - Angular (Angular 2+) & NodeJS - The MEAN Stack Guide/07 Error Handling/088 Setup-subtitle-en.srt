00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:03,184
<v Instructor>The way I want to handle errors</v>

2
00:00:03,184 --> 00:00:05,319
is here in my front-end I will create

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:09,914
a new feature, a new directory which I'll name errors.

4
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:11,794
I will have an error component

5
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,464
which holds the modal I want to show

6
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:15,356
and I will use the error service

7
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:19,951
to control when this modal should appear and when not.

8
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:22,519
I will also create an error model.

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,157
So, a file which defines how our error

10
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,791
should look like in the front end.

11
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,126
So let me create these files first.

12
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:33,502
This is an error component dot ts file for,

13
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:35,411
well, the component, you guessed it.

14
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,958
The error service dot ts file for

15
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,778
the service I'm going to use.

16
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:42,152
And the error model dot ts file

17
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:44,472
for the error model.

18
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:46,101
Well let's have the model first

19
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,974
since this is a key part.

20
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:53,869
Here I will export a class named error, for example.

21
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:56,211
And then I will use the short and quick way

22
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:58,898
of setting it up by defining the properties

23
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:01,588
here in the constructor by prepending them

24
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:05,758
with this access modifier, public or private.

25
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:07,868
So what should an error look like?

26
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,694
Well let's have a look at our back end.

27
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,236
How do the errors look like with fro?

28
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:15,120
Our errors here always have a title,

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,863
and then the actual error object.

30
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:22,468
So it does the case here and here, and always.

31
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:26,099
Now this of course allows me to now

32
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,266
go to my error model and set this object up in the same way.

33
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:34,352
So here I want to have a public title,

34
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:36,685
which is a string, and then I want to have

35
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:39,897
well, let's say a error object

36
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:41,858
which could be of type any.

37
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:44,898
Or since I also do know that all these

38
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:47,099
error objects on the back end

39
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,841
do have a message, I could also call this message.

40
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:52,939
Of course I will need to make sure

41
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:56,401
to extract this message from the error object.

42
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:59,719
As a side note, why do I know that on the back end,

43
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,700
this error object fro by mongoose

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,386
does have a message property?

45
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:06,846
Well simply by inspecting it or

46
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:08,882
reading it in the documentation.

47
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:12,048
So this will have a message, and all my

48
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,715
custom errors like this one here

49
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,152
also do have this message property.

50
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:19,742
So I can extract the message,

51
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:22,569
and this is what I wanna use in my model here.

52
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:25,145
This is the basic setup I wanna use.

53
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,116
With this, I can next work on the component

54
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:30,940
to create a nice modal I wanna display

55
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,607
when a error occurs.
