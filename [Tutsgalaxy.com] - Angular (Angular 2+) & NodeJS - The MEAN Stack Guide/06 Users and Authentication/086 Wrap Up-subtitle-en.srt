1
00:00:01,976 --> 00:00:03,885
<v Instructor>In this module we achieved a lot.</v>

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:07,727
We implemented our User Authentication Workflow.

3
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:10,483
We are now able to create users to sign them in

4
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:13,234
and, more than that, we're able to use them to see if

5
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:14,816
we are authenticated,

6
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:17,261
if we are allowed to create new messages,

7
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:20,406
if we are allowed to edit or delete messages.

8
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:23,955
We implemented these checks both on the front and,

9
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:26,159
very important, on the back end.

10
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,137
I want to highlight this again.

11
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:31,054
Checking it on the front end is not a protection.

12
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:34,696
Users are able to read and edit your JavaScript code

13
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:35,886
in the end.

14
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:38,637
You can make it hard but you can't prevent this.

15
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:41,553
So it's important to do the sensible validation,

16
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:44,744
the sensible checks on your back end.

17
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,291
And, we do do this.

18
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:50,458
We do check in the messages JS file if the token is valid.

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,565
We do check here if the user who wants to edit something

20
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:58,287
is the user who created this message.

21
00:00:58,287 --> 00:01:00,277
So these checks are key.

22
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:04,136
But then we also added them to the front end, like here,

23
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:07,325
to make sure that we provide a nice user experience,

24
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:10,426
and we don't see buttons which we shouldn't see.

25
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:14,540
With that our application really evolved quite a bit

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,936
and I really like the state of it.

27
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:19,493
Now I wanna conclude it in the next section

28
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:21,502
by adding error handling.

29
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:25,924
So that in the case I'm not logged in, whoops like this,

30
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:28,713
and then I hit this Save button.

31
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,880
I not only see

32
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:33,665
this error message

33
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,897
but instead I get a nice popup

34
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:38,066
informing me that I'm not logged in.

35
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,418
I need to login.

36
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:42,501
So let's do this in the next module.
