00:00:01,611 --> 00:00:03,038
<v Instructor>To show or hide these tabs,</v>

2
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:06,451
I need to determine if the user is logged in or not.

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:09,475
Now, I could store a variable in my auth service,

4
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:13,672
which says is logged in and is true or false.

5
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:16,941
But keep in mind, our token persists

6
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:19,940
even if we refresh the browser page.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,323
So in this case, we would then also need to

8
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:25,093
on each startup of our Angular 2 application,

9
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:28,773
check if we do have a token, and if we do have a token,

10
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:31,323
we need to set this to is logged in.

11
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,572
That's not really how I wanna do it.

12
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:36,097
So, I will do it differently, and then it is actually

13
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:40,018
really easy to find out if the user is logged in.

14
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:43,087
I will add a new method, is logged in,

15
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:45,239
which should return true or false,

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,519
and now how can I determine if the user is logged in?

17
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,458
Well, I can simply check if the token exists

18
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:54,016
because I do clear my local storage on logout.

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,479
If I don't have a token, I'm not logged in.

20
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,767
It's as simple as this.

21
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:01,736
So here, I can simply return local storage,

22
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:03,399
get item,

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,232
token,

24
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:10,805
not equal to null, so if it's not equal to null,

25
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:14,738
it means we have a token, in which case I would return true

26
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:17,554
which is what I wanna return for the question

27
00:01:17,554 --> 00:01:20,786
is logged in, but if it is null, we will return false,

28
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,666
so we are not logged in.

29
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,567
With this set up, I can go to my authentication component

30
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,007
here, which holds my navigation,

31
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:31,367
and here I of course will inject my auth service

32
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,538
to get access to this newly created method,

33
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:37,726
so add auth service here, of course, make sure to add

34
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:41,908
the import at the top, and then here, I will also add

35
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:45,575
another method, which I will also simply name

36
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:48,967
is logged in, just to make this really clear

37
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:50,666
what's happening.

38
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,006
And here, we will reach out to the auth service

39
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:54,626
called is logged in,

40
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:58,454
and return the result of this call, is simply pass it along,

41
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:01,287
so that here, all I have to do is,

42
00:02:02,186 --> 00:02:05,103
I have to add some ngIf directives.

43
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,501
Mainly, I will check on this list item

44
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:12,585
if ngIf will only attach it

45
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:17,232
if it is not, if the user is not logged in

46
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:19,280
because only if the user is not logged in

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,881
we'll want to show this sign-in page.

48
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:24,342
On the other hand, the logout button should only be shown

49
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:26,672
if the user is logged in, so here,

50
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:30,131
I don't have an exclamation mark at the beginning.

51
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:31,808
With this setup, I can save this

52
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,225
to recompile the application.

53
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:38,928
And I can then head over to the application and reload it.

54
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:42,576
And we see the logout ribbon is not available,

55
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:46,116
but as soon as I do log in, we are redirected,

56
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:50,107
and now we only got the logout tab and not the sign-in tab.

57
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,187
Signing up is always possible, of course, you could

58
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:54,486
disable this, but I'm find with this.

59
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:57,947
So now, we're only showing the options I wanna show.

60
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:00,216
And as soon as I click logout, we switch to sign in,

61
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:02,126
and the logout tab is gone.

62
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,442
So now we're showing these tabs depending

63
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:07,315
on the user log-in state, which is great.

64
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:11,135
The next step is to secure our content and use the token

65
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:14,434
we are issuing to make sure only authenticated users

66
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:17,351
are able to create posts and so on.
