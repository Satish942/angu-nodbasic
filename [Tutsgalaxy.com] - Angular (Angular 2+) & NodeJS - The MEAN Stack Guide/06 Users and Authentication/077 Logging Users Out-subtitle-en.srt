1
00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:03,940
<v Instructor>Now, before making the next steps</v>

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,573
and securing the content of my application,

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,604
I want to do one other thing.

4
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:11,862
I want to make this Logout button work,

5
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:14,166
and I also want to make sure that I don't see the

6
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:17,589
Signin tab if I already am signed in,

7
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,777
and that I don't see the Logout tab

8
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:21,787
if I'm not logged in.

9
00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:23,338
So, that these are only shown

10
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:26,277
depending on my login state.

11
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,704
Let's start by implementing the Logout button.

12
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:29,830
In the authService,

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,539
I'll add a new method here

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,831
to simply have all of my authentication-related

15
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,741
methods in one place.

16
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:40,859
And here, logout is simply a function or a method

17
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:42,436
which takes no argument.

18
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:45,439
And what will this function do?

19
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,366
It will simply take my local storage and clear it,

20
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,608
because I want to delete both

21
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:53,002
the user id and my token.

22
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:54,918
And with that, the only thing

23
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:58,498
which would give me access to restricted resources,

24
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:00,162
my token, is gone

25
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:02,429
and that basically means I am locked out.

26
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,401
There is no session to invalidate.

27
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,444
But without the token, I can't do anything.

28
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:08,562
So, I am locked out with that.

29
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:11,466
Now with this, I can go to my LogoutComponent.

30
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:13,147
I do have the onLogout method

31
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:15,625
which is triggered once I click this button.

32
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,964
And here I want to use my authService,

33
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:20,820
so let me add a constructor

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,584
and store the authService

35
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,907
in this AuthService property.

36
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:26,459
Of course, you need to add the import

37
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,775
to authService at the top.

38
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:32,135
And, I not only want to trigger this logout function

39
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,244
in the authService,

40
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:35,452
I also want to navigate away.

41
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:40,097
So I will also inject the Angular to Router here.

42
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:42,189
Of course, the Router therefore, also needs

43
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,875
to be imported from .@angular/router.

44
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,712
And then in the onLogout method here,

45
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:50,302
I can call this authService, logout,

46
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:52,133
the function I just created.

47
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:55,283
And I can call this router, navigate,

48
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:56,450
and then pass

49
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,721
an array of URL segments.

50
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:02,612
And here, let's say I want to go to auth,

51
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:03,445
and then

52
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:05,300
signin.

53
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:09,472
So, with this set up,

54
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,846
let's re-compile this.

55
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:13,334
We don't need to restart the server

56
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,867
because we didn't change anything there.

57
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:18,520
If it's false, let's try it again.

58
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,770
It should work.

59
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:22,137
Yeah.

60
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,197
Looks better.

61
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:26,113
So with that, let me reload this application,

62
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,186
and hit this Logout button.

63
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:29,909
I get re-directed to the Signin page.

64
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:30,742
Great.

65
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:32,694
And if we go to the application here,

66
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,268
we see that indeed, our local storage was cleared.

67
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:38,655
So this is the working Logout button.

68
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:40,720
The next step is to now, conditionally,

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
show or hide these tabs.
