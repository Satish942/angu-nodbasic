1
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:03,302
<v Instructor>So welcome back</v>

2
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:05,496
to another section in this course.

3
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:08,315
We left with a working Messenger part,

4
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:12,797
so we're able to save messages to our database,

5
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:14,797
to edit them, like this,

6
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:19,045
to save this and have these changes persist in our database.

7
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:21,544
Of course, we're also able to delete them.

8
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:22,536
That is great,

9
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:25,204
but there is a missing piece in this application.

10
00:00:25,204 --> 00:00:27,424
The Authentication part here is not working,

11
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:30,481
so we're not able to sign up users, to sign in users,

12
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:33,246
and therefore we're also not able

13
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:36,038
to map our messages to users.

14
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:37,038
This is why,

15
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:40,579
if I create a new message here,

16
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,418
we always see Dummy here.

17
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:43,619
We just don't have a user

18
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,916
to whom we could attach this message.

19
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,467
So this is something we'll have to change,

20
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,184
and in this module,

21
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,917
I will show you how to implement user features,

22
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:56,888
and that of course, not only includes creating a user,

23
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:58,761
but also signing in a user,

24
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:01,641
and learning what the signing in a user

25
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:05,943
in a Angular 2, NodeJS application actually mean.

26
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:08,001
Because, as you will learn, it's different

27
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:12,441
from your normal NodeJS and Express only application.

28
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,441
So let's dive into this.
