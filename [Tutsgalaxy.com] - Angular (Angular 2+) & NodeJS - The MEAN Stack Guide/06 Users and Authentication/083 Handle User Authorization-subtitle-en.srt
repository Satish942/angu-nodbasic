1
00:00:02,448 --> 00:00:04,508
<v Voiceover>In order to ensure that only users</v>

2
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:07,145
who created a post are able to add it or delete it.

3
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:10,218
I need to work on the patch and delete routes here

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:14,324
on my back end. Specifically I need to fetch the user there

5
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:16,306
and check if this is the user,

6
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:18,820
who actually created the message.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,148
Thankfully we know how to fetch the user.

8
00:00:21,148 --> 00:00:23,907
I can extract it from the decoded token,

9
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:27,181
so let's just copy this code from the post route.

10
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:29,266
So with that we get access to the token,

11
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:31,661
or to the value stored in the token.

12
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:33,920
Again keep in mind we should only use this

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,813
after validating the token, which we do here.

14
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:41,185
So with this, we're able to access the user.

15
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:43,023
So what I want to do here is,

16
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:44,702
I want to check if we got an error.

17
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:49,610
If we don't find a message. But then I only want to check

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,110
if my message user

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,016
is the same,

20
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,009
or to be precise here is not the same.

21
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:00,316
As the user stored in my token.

22
00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:02,494
So I want to compare the user ID's here,

23
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:05,839
since message.user is just the user ID.

24
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:10,121
It's not the complete user object, it's simply the ID.

25
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:13,026
So if they are not equal, I know that a different

26
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:15,286
user is trying to delete this message.

27
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:17,879
Then who created this message?

28
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,746
So in this case, I don't want to allow this.

29
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,163
I want to return,

30
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:27,667
let's say this error here.

31
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:31,782
The not authenticated error we set up here.

32
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:33,491
Here we are.

33
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:34,896
Let's return this in this case.

34
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:38,217
Of course without the error check here, just like this.

35
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:42,384
I want to implement the same check when deleting this.

36
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:44,785
So down here,

37
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:46,728
I will now

38
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:49,432
add this check

39
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:51,885
in here too,

40
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:55,121
before removing it. Let's check is users are equal.

41
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:58,787
If they are not, return with a status code of 401.

42
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:01,777
Of course, this shouldn't be error

43
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:04,720
since we don't have the error object here.

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,553
Here I will simply say

45
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:09,205
"users do not match"

46
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,081
and quickly copy this up here.

47
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,128
Here too.

48
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:19,742
So with that, we set this up to make sure

49
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:22,191
that unauthenticated users are not able to delete

50
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:24,897
other users posts and messages.

51
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:29,483
Let's see this in action, by restarting the server

52
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,979
and reloading our front end page.

53
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,725
Though that wouldn't have been necessary.

54
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:37,771
Let's create a new message here,

55
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,441
and then switch the user.

56
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:41,969
So now I'll log in with my other user

57
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,126
and I'll try to delete this. So let's clear the console.

58
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:48,388
It is deleted here, but again only because

59
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:50,715
we don't check it in the front end yet.

60
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:54,557
But as you see, I do get the error and if I reload

61
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,725
the message is back.

62
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:59,675
The same should be true for editing.

63
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:02,756
Which also, if I change it.

64
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:04,924
Shouldn't be stored on the server.

65
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:08,381
Looks great, so we get this additional route protection.

66
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:12,249
Of course we still need to polish our front end,

67
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:14,110
So that we don't see these buttons

68
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,440
if they give us an error anyways.

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,607
We also want to output the user name here of course.
