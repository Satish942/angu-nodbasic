00:00:01,423 --> 00:00:02,750
<v Instructor>Back in the project,</v>

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,622
I wanna create such a new service.

3
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:06,180
It's going to be a service used

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,948
in my messages feature here.

5
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:10,212
So I'm going to create this file

6
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:12,296
in this messages folder, and a fitting name

7
00:00:12,296 --> 00:00:14,778
would be message.service.ts since

8
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:17,926
this will be a service for my messages.

9
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:19,721
Now how does such a service look like?

10
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,842
It's a normal class, which we export

11
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:24,958
to make it usable outside of this file too.

12
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,329
And I'm not going to name it just service.

13
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,806
I'm going to name it message service,

14
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:32,810
since it will hold my message related things.

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,689
Now in this service, a very important thing

16
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:39,276
which I wanna have is my array of messages.

17
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:41,367
So this will be of type message,

18
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:44,575
which needs to be imported from ./message.model

19
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:47,521
so my own male model here, of type message array.

20
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,519
And it will be an empty array let's say for now.

21
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:54,291
So this is my central messages array

22
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,068
which I will soon use to store and manage

23
00:00:57,068 --> 00:01:00,735
all my messages in my front end application.

24
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:03,292
Now in order to be able to use this array,

25
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:06,792
I want to create a at message method here,

26
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:10,220
which allows me to add a new message

27
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,778
to this property or to this central array.

28
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:17,727
And here I expect to get a message as an argument.

29
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:20,006
Of course this should be of type message.

30
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,335
And then I can simply use my messages array

31
00:01:22,335 --> 00:01:25,583
to push this new message on it.

32
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,953
You can, by the way, make this a private property

33
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:31,189
which is not accessible from outside.

34
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:33,571
As the next step I also want to be able to

35
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:35,389
get my messages here, so let's add

36
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:37,402
a get messages method to this class

37
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:40,392
which simply returns my messages array here

38
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:44,210
so that I have access to the central array.

39
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,061
And I want to add one other method.

40
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:49,289
Adding and getting messages is great,

41
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:52,206
we'll soon also add an edit method,

42
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:55,049
but for now I want to implement

43
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,249
a delete message method, which allows me to

44
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:01,915
pass a message to this method here.

45
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:04,887
And then here I want to take my messages array

46
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:07,474
and splice it and remove one element

47
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,617
with the splice method.

48
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:12,487
I want to start at the index of the message

49
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:14,611
and passing as an argument.

50
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:16,739
I'm getting this index with the index.of method

51
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,423
on my messages array.

52
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:20,673
And then I want to splice exactly one element,

53
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,450
so remove this one element from this array.

54
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,066
This will alter this array and remove

55
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:28,664
that element I want to remove.

56
00:02:28,664 --> 00:02:31,840
With this, this is the functionality,

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,377
I want to outsource in a separate file

58
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:36,159
in this message service.

59
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,466
I can then use this message service

60
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:41,329
and other components to, in one component,

61
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:45,385
add a message, in another component, get messages.

62
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:47,743
I will extend this service in the next videos,

63
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:50,052
but for now let's hook up this

64
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:52,552
at message functionality here.
