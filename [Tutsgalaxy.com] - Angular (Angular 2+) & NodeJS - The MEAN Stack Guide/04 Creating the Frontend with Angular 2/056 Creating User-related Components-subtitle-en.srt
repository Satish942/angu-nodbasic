1
00:00:01,394 --> 00:00:03,017
<v Instructor>With that out of the way,</v>

2
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:05,501
let's work on the Authentication section next.

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:09,076
Here I want to create a couple of components to work with

4
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,363
which I will extend in the next modules,

5
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:14,902
but where I want to start working on right now.

6
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:17,349
We got our authentication component,

7
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,680
but specifically I want to have components

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,874
for signing a user up, in, and logging him out.

9
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:26,624
So I'll need a sign up component.

10
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:33,085
I'll also need a sign in component

11
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:40,952
and I'll also need a log out component, like this.

12
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:42,799
Let's work on the log out component first.

13
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,732
It's the easiest one.

14
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:48,439
Here I'll export a class named Log out Component

15
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,927
and, you already guessed it,

16
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:52,871
of course I'm going to attach my component decorator

17
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:56,770
which needs to be imported from @angular/core.

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,738
I will give this a selector of let's say app log out,

19
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,103
whatever you like.

20
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:06,137
Here I'll also create a inline template,

21
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:09,809
so no external file and in here all I want to have

22
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:12,454
is I want to have my bootstrap classes

23
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:16,522
to again centre this nicely like before.

24
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:19,855
In this div here I want to have a button

25
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,343
with a class of button button danger

26
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:27,488
which says log out and which upon clicking it

27
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,988
fires a click event on log out

28
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:34,465
which I will fill with some logic later on.

29
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:36,533
I will set it up now, though.

30
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:37,587
So this will be fired.

31
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:39,898
It doesn't do anything right now, though.

32
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:43,188
Now I will add it to my app module here,

33
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,109
the logout component,

34
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:48,433
I'll also add the import here,

35
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:49,676
but what I won't do is

36
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,000
I will not add it to my authentication component.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,695
Why? Because after setting up my next components,

38
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:58,221
sign in and sign up,

39
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:00,906
I will add child routing here,

40
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:03,585
which means I want to have some sub-routes

41
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:06,218
for my authentication related routes

42
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:07,717
so that I later on have routes

43
00:02:07,717 --> 00:02:12,368
like auth/logout, auth/signup and so on.

44
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:14,930
So I want to load these components,

45
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,769
these nest components here conditionally

46
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,819
and not hard code them in here.

47
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,481
It's different for the messages area

48
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:25,212
where I simply structure them all on one page.

49
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,702
But for authentication, I want to have multiple pages.

50
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:29,727
To see this in action,

51
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:33,452
I will quickly set up my other two components,

52
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:35,285
sign up component here

53
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:38,181
and then, thereafter, sign in.

54
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,633
Both are, of course, created by adding

55
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:44,980
the component decorator and imported as always.

56
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,753
Then they should get a selector

57
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:48,753
of let's say app sign up

58
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,394
and then a template URL here,

59
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:55,187
I'm going to use a external file again,

60
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:57,104
sign up component HTML,

61
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:59,636
which I'm going to create.

62
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:01,969
I'll also create such a file

63
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:05,181
for the sign in component,

64
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:09,264
So sign up and thereafter sign in component HTML.

65
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:13,373
Because I will basically just copy the code

66
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:14,905
from the sign up component

67
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:17,463
into my sign in component typescript file,

68
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,499
of course, change the selector,

69
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,807
change the template, sign in,

70
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:24,935
and change the name of the component here.

71
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:27,286
Also register all these components

72
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:28,701
here in the app module,

73
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:32,284
so sign up component and sign in component.

74
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:35,243
With that, I have created all these components

75
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:38,076
and I will simply say sign up here

76
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,122
in the sign up template,

77
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:42,632
this will change later of course,

78
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:45,300
and sign in in the sign in template,

79
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,613
and on the log out template, remember,

80
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:47,996
we have this button.

81
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:50,160
Again, I will adjust the content later on.

82
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,888
For now, let's keep it simple.

83
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:55,531
Next, I want to set up this child routing

84
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:58,499
so that I can load one of these three components,

85
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:01,749
log out, sign up, sign in, when needed.
