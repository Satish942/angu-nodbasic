1
00:00:01,648 --> 00:00:03,930
<v Instructor>The problem we do have is</v>

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,666
that we want to use the message.content and message.author

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:09,586
here in the MessageComponent,

4
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:11,071
but we don't have that property

5
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:13,685
here in the MessageComponent TypeScript file.

6
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:16,288
We do have it in the AppComponent, instead.

7
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:18,666
So now, we could, of course, copy it,

8
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,994
but let me show you how to use property binding

9
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:24,239
to pass it as an argument to this component,

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,599
which we're using in our AppComponent.

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,087
We can do this by going back to the MessageComponent

12
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:34,805
TypeScript file and setting up a new property here.

13
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:37,434
Let's also name it message, like it is named

14
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:39,770
in the AppComponent, but that is optional.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,476
You can use any name you want.

16
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,898
Now, here, let's make it of type Message.

17
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:49,000
If you remember, this is the model we created a while ago.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,085
So, assign Message here, and then add the import

19
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:57,240
to Message from ./message.model,

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,290
which is the file here, which we placed in the same folder.

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,112
This is a simple type assignment

22
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:07,193
which now makes sure that all messages we use here

23
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:11,568
have to follow the structure laid out in this model.

24
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:14,055
So, they have to have a username and content,

25
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:17,237
and, optionally, also have messageId and userId.

26
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:20,275
Also, these types here have to match.

27
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:23,119
So, with that, Message should be, let's say,

28
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,240
undefined at the beginning.

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,610
So let's not assign a value.

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,471
What I want to make, though, is,

31
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:31,378
I want to make it assignable from outside.

32
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:33,461
So I will add @Input here

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,769
from @angular/core.

34
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:42,460
So, make sure to add this import at the top, too.

35
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,138
And don't forget the parentheses.

36
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,920
Now, what this will do is, it allows me,

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,923
in my app component HTML file,

38
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:53,970
where I use my component here, the app-message component,

39
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,735
to pass an argument by adding square brackets,

40
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:02,655
then message, which is the name of the property set up here,

41
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,850
and then, whichever value I want to pass.

42
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,223
Now, the value I want to pass is

43
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:11,556
the message property of my AppComponent.

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,816
This one here.

45
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:17,661
Now, right now, this is not adhering to my message model,

46
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:21,147
so I will also assign my message model here.

47
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:26,003
Also add the import to ./messages/message.model.

48
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:30,705
Now, I will use the constructor of my message model here.

49
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:34,872
And here, I will pass a message, and then my author.

50
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,392
Remember, the other arguments are optional.

51
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,647
I don't need to set them up.

52
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:43,855
So, with that, this is my new message property

53
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:46,228
in the AppComponent, and I'm passing

54
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:49,728
this message property as an argument here,

55
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:53,092
between the quotation marks, to the message,

56
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:56,127
and these names match, but they don't have to match,

57
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:59,076
to the message property in my MessageComponent.

58
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:02,114
And here, I could use the alias I was talking about

59
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:04,835
to, for example, name this InputMessage,

60
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:07,326
and then I could use this alias here

61
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:09,392
between the square brackets.

62
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:12,418
Not only could, I would now have to use it.

63
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:16,596
But I'll revert this and go back to the non-alias version.

64
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,097
So, let me quickly remove it here.

65
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:21,242
Now, with this in place, if I save this

66
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,329
and let it recompile, I can reload the application,

67
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,292
and now, we see the content again.

68
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,102
We don't see the author, because

69
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:32,294
it's now no longer an author, but instead, username.

70
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:35,392
So if I change this here in my message.component.html file

71
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:38,409
and recompile again, and reload again,

72
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,140
we now see the same as before,

73
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,806
but the key difference is, the message

74
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,208
is now passed dynamically from outside.

75
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,609
And this is a huge and very important feature

76
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,649
Angular 2 offers you, which allows you

77
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:53,553
to really make your application dynamic

78
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:56,670
and communicate between your components,

79
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,233
which is, of course, very important,

80
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:01,066
because you often need to do that.
