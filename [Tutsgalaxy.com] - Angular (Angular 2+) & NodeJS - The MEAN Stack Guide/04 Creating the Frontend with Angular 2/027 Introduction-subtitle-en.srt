1
00:00:01,837 --> 00:00:02,918
<v Instructor>So at this point of time</v>

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:04,923
you got a refresher on Node.js.

3
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:07,213
You know how our general application works,

4
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:08,951
how our files are getting served,

5
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:11,017
and how we route in Node.js.

6
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:14,177
You also got a refresher in MongoDB

7
00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:15,572
and learned how to store data

8
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:17,042
in the Mongo database.

9
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:18,560
We also, and that is important for

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,453
the rest of this course and this

11
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,096
application we're building here.

12
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:25,256
We also set up our models here in the models folder.

13
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:27,098
We're going to use them in later modules

14
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:30,500
in this course to save our messages and users

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,497
when we then create them Y Angular 2 to the database.

16
00:00:35,497 --> 00:00:37,053
Speaking of Angular 2, we haven't

17
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:39,071
seen much of that, have we?

18
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:40,774
Now in this module it's finally time

19
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,639
to get to the point and use Angular 2.

20
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:47,099
Now this module here, we'll set up

21
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:49,498
the whole front end of our application

22
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:51,364
and I will use it to also repeat

23
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:53,836
some of the concepts we're using

24
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:55,058
throughout this module and some of

25
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:58,198
the core concepts of Angular 2, therefore.

26
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:00,661
If you feel like that's not enough

27
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,518
and you need more Angular 2 knowledge,

28
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:06,125
I definitely recommend diving in a dedicated course.

29
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,845
With that, let's get started and let's learn

30
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:12,309
how we can actually start our Angular 2 application

31
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:14,842
through our Node.js application

32
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,175
which you've built thus far.
