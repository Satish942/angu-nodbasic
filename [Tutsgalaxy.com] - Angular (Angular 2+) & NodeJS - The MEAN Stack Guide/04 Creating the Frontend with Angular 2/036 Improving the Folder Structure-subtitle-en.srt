1
00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:03,851
<v Instructor>Now as we can see our app folder is</v>

2
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:07,384
already getting pretty crowded and it's a good practise

3
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:09,561
to structure your project.

4
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:13,089
You want to create sub-folders to keep your project clean

5
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:16,508
and keep the possibility to quickly navigate and see

6
00:00:16,508 --> 00:00:19,584
what is located where and so on.

7
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:22,580
Now how do you structure Angular2 project?

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,487
It's a good practise to structure it by feature.

9
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:29,287
So I will not create a folder named models

10
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:33,935
and then a folder named components, like this.

11
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:36,319
This is not how you should structure it.

12
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:39,991
This will quickly get it unmaintainable

13
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:43,074
and hard to understand once it grows.

14
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:46,303
Instead structure it by feature.

15
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:49,386
So here we'll have a messages feature

16
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:53,723
and we'll also have a off feature,

17
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:56,058
so user related stuff.

18
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:58,450
With that I can move my messages model to the

19
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,156
messages folder and the user model to the off folder.

20
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:04,339
I'll keep the other files in the app folder

21
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:07,935
but these will be the only files I have there pretty much.

22
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,842
All other components and so on, which I'll soon create,

23
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:13,068
will go into sub-folders too.

24
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:16,835
So here in the app folder, in the root folder there,

25
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,527
I only want to have files which are related to the

26
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:24,459
start up of the application, really to the root application.

27
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,959
All other things will go into sub-folders.
