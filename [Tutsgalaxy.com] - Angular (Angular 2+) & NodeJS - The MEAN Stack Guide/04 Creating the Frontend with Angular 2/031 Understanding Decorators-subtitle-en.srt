1
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:02,899
<v Instructor>Now all the things you are seeing here,</v>

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,837
are contained in an object,

3
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,435
or are properties of an object,

4
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:11,115
which is passed as an argument to @NgModule thing here.

5
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,085
Now this thing is a decorator,

6
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:15,416
decorator is a types group feature,

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,296
which allows us to attach some additional information

8
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:19,804
to a class.

9
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:21,583
As you can see, the class is totally empty,

10
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,976
there are no properties or methods inside of it.

11
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:28,064
So this class becomes more than just an empty class,

12
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:29,856
by adding this decorator.

13
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:32,195
You'll see this same concept throughout angular2 ,

14
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,904
for example when we use components,

15
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:36,104
which you'll learn about in a second.

16
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:40,664
We pass arguments to this NgModule decorator,

17
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,325
and in the background angular2 will use these arguments,

18
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:45,776
to store it, you could think of,

19
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:49,153
and then know that whenever we use the AppModule class,

20
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:51,382
it is more than an empty class.

21
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:53,875
It is configured with the info we set up here

22
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,125
in the @NgModule decorator.
