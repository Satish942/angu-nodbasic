1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,389
<v Instructor>We're almost there.</v>

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,286
I will now copy all that code here,

3
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:07,592
in my

4
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:09,048
class body

5
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:10,474
to my signin component,

6
00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:14,108
since it will also use this approach of creating a form.

7
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:15,678
Of course, you should then also

8
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:19,069
copy all these form-related imports here

9
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:20,399
into the signin component,

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,183
so that this is all enabled again.

11
00:00:23,183 --> 00:00:26,393
And, of course, we also need to synchronise this.

12
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,407
So I'm simply copying

13
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:29,923
the template of the signup form,

14
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:33,238
though here I only need email and passwords.

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:34,850
So, I will remove the inputs

16
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,048
for first and last name,

17
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:38,504
and then of course all that means

18
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:40,949
that in my signin component TypeScript class,

19
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:43,605
I will remove these controls here too.

20
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:45,910
So now I do have a lighter version

21
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,333
of the signup form here in the signin component,

22
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,153
which means that if I reload the application

23
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:54,551
I now get the signin component here.

24
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:57,325
Still has the same functionality as before,

25
00:00:57,325 --> 00:01:00,649
but now only for mail and password.

26
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:02,416
With this we got our application

27
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,575
or frontend almost finished.

28
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:06,272
We've got our authentication section here

29
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:08,051
with Signup, Signin, and Logout,

30
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:10,528
which we can switch with child routing.

31
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,939
Get our Messenger, where we can

32
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,178
add new routes.

33
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:16,021
The one thing I want to fix, or add now

34
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:18,244
before moving on to the next module,

35
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,353
where you've finally connected to Node.js;

36
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:23,989
so bring these two pieces together,

37
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:25,695
is these two buttons.

38
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:26,981
Deleting doesn't work,

39
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:28,541
and reloads it actually.

40
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,871
And the same is true for editing,

41
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:30,992
which does work,

42
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:33,995
though it only replaces it with some static text,

43
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:36,419
but then also reloads the page.

44
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:38,975
I will leave the static text for editing,

45
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:41,163
but I want to hook up the delete button,

46
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:44,999
and I also want to remove this unnecessary reloading,

47
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:47,509
or this annoying reloading.

48
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,853
Back in the message-component.html file,

49
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:53,189
the reloading is triggered by these references here.

50
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,030
Because now with routing in place,

51
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,864
this simply triggers a reload.

52
00:01:56,864 --> 00:02:00,094
So by removing it, I get rid of this annoying feature,

53
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:01,094
or function.

54
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:04,613
I also want to hook up the delete button.

55
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:07,247
So let's execute onDelete here.

56
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:10,833
Of course, this new method should now be added here.

57
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,380
And remember, we already do have the delete method

58
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,825
in the messages-service here.

59
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:19,491
So therefore, I can simply

60
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:22,457
inject this messageService here too,

61
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:24,489
in the message component.

62
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:29,103
So messageService should get injected here too.

63
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:32,770
Make sure to add the import at the top here.

64
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,920
And with this message now available,

65
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,394
note is it's the same instance

66
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:40,505
as in the input and list component,

67
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:43,189
since I provided in this messages component

68
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:44,904
which holds them all.

69
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:46,632
So since it is the same instance,

70
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:50,580
I can simply call this.messageService.deleteMessage,

71
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,080
and here, I pass this.message.

72
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,481
So the message which I get

73
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:58,176
passed into this component from outside;

74
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,829
which is the currently loaded one.

75
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:01,996
So, with that,

76
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,533
if I reload my application again

77
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,404
and add a new message,

78
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,249
you see editing doesn't reload,

79
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:13,501
and deleting, well, deletes it.

80
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:15,601
This is the finished front end.

81
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:18,547
Now let's move on to the Node.js section

82
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,047
and add the backend so that the messages

83
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:23,086
are stored on the server,

84
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,608
are really edited,

85
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,056
and are really fetched

86
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:27,528
from the server.

87
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,195
So, time to move on.
