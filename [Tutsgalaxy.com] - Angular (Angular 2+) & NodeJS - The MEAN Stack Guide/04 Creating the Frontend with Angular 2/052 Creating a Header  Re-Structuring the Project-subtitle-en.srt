1
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:03,439
<v Narrator>It's nice that the messaging part</v>

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,071
is developing well but we also have

3
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:09,646
this auth part and we haven't really worked on that.

4
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:12,812
Right now our whole app component only represents

5
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,777
the messages part.

6
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:16,693
I want to change this.

7
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:20,223
I now also want to start working on the authentication part

8
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:21,906
and more than that I also want

9
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:23,713
to implement routing, which means I want

10
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:26,586
to be able to switch between my messages part

11
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:28,634
and my authentication part.

12
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:29,908
So in one part I want to be able

13
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:31,993
to still create and see my messages

14
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:34,416
but in the other part I want to be able

15
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,833
to sign up or sign in a user.

16
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,901
Well for that I need routing.

17
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:42,915
I want to be able to load different pages

18
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:46,449
depending on different links on which I clicked.

19
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:49,910
To do so, I will add yet another component

20
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,688
to my messages feature file here for the folder.

21
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:56,188
The messages component dot TS.

22
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,541
So I already have a message component

23
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,473
which represents a single message.

24
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:06,373
This now should represent my whole messages feature,

25
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:08,433
this messages part here.

26
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:12,463
So here I will export my messages component

27
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,927
and of course you already guessed it,

28
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:18,008
I will add my component decorator to this

29
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:22,727
which needs to be imported from @AngularCore like always.

30
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:27,445
Here I'll pass my auth check and we'll set up the selector.

31
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:29,695
Let's name it App Messages.

32
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,202
I also want to set up the template

33
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:35,336
and you could use an external file.

34
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:37,675
I'm going to use an inline template again

35
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:40,345
like this with back ticks.

36
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:42,032
And in this template I want to have

37
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:46,199
all the code I have here in my app component HTML file.

38
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,553
Because again, I want to have this messages component

39
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:57,030
to be the responsible part for my messages feature.

40
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,197
So with this I created my separate app messages component

41
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:06,018
and now I could include it like this here

42
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:08,434
but I don't want to do that

43
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:10,526
because I want to use routing.

44
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:13,641
I still need to register it in my module here.

45
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:18,197
So here it's time to now add my messages component

46
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:20,244
also at the import, so that we're able

47
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:22,571
to use it in routing later on.

48
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:24,376
Before adding routing, let me also add

49
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:26,993
a component to the auth file.

50
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:28,628
To the auth folder.

51
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:32,617
Authentication dot component dot TS will be the file name

52
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:34,744
and in here I'll also export a class

53
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:37,327
named Authentication Component.

54
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:43,704
Here I'll also assign a decorator component like this.

55
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:48,431
Imported from @AngularCore as always

56
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:52,598
and let's give it a selector of app authentication.

57
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:56,175
The template will grow later on.

58
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,610
For now all I will do here

59
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,560
is I will simply output an H1 tag

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,856
where I say authentication to know

61
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:05,143
that we successfully got there.

62
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,636
I also won't include this is my app component template

63
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:10,351
but again I also need to add it

64
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:13,098
to my app module to make Angular2 aware

65
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:15,443
of this component so that I can use it

66
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:17,530
in routing later on.

67
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,197
Also add the import.

68
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:23,803
Now I finally also want to create a header

69
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,214
and I will store this in the app folder.

70
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:28,392
Though I could create a subfolder

71
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,814
named Shared or something like this.

72
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:33,845
Here the header component should,

73
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:35,321
well you might have expected it,

74
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:36,571
hold my header.

75
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:40,966
So in here I'll also export this class,

76
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:44,216
Header Component at Component Decorator

77
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,150
with your shallow grouped object passed here

78
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,314
and this should get a selector of App Header

79
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:56,499
and then again a template.

80
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:58,549
I'm going to use an in line template here too.

81
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,047
You might outsource it if you prefer that of course

82
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,880
and there a header with class row.

83
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:10,798
And then a Nav element with the classes Col MD Eight

84
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:13,412
and then Col MD offset to elect

85
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:17,640
the four Bootstrap grid classes to style it nicely

86
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,595
and in here let's give this

87
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:24,651
an ordered list with the class Nav, Nav Pills.

88
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:28,006
This is just Pills Navigation look Bootstrap offers us.

89
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,615
You can find it on Get Bootstrap dot com of course

90
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:33,614
if you want to learn more about that.

91
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:35,054
Oops.

92
00:04:35,054 --> 00:04:38,614
And in here let's create two list items

93
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:41,447
with anchor text to have my links.

94
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,290
I want to have a messenger link

95
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,607
and let's say an authentication link.

96
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,688
I will remove the href element

97
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:57,608
because I will replace this later on,

98
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,496
but for now I will leave it like this

99
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,670
and register this header component

100
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,837
which now, until now only has a default Bootstrap styling

101
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:10,695
to the app module, also add the import.

102
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,475
This allows me in my app component HTML file

103
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:16,475
to include the app header like that.

104
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:20,483
So if I save this and reload the application

105
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:23,222
we now see this header with the two pills.

106
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,233
No pill is active right now

107
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:28,234
and while the routing of course doesn't work.

108
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:31,817
So we clearly can improve this a bit more.
