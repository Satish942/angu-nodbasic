1
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:05,592
<v ->In this course, and in probably any real application,</v>

2
00:00:05,592 --> 00:00:07,964
we not only want to send data to the server

3
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:09,478
to then do nothing there.

4
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:11,033
We want to store it in a database,

5
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:13,942
we want to be able to retrieve it from a database.

6
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:16,552
As a database, in this course we will use MongoDB,

7
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:19,458
which is a very popular choice for Angular2

8
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,715
and Node.js as applications.

9
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:23,119
You're not limited to MongoDB,

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,842
you may chose any database of your choice, or preference.

11
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:30,120
But again, in this course, I will go with MongoDB.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,224
Now for developing, we will all need to set it up

13
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:35,638
on our local machines so that we can test it

14
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:37,022
and work with it.

15
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:38,633
How do we set it up?

16
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:42,492
Well, first we need to download MongoDB and extract it.

17
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:44,535
And then we also need to move a folder.

18
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:46,827
I will walk you though these steps.

19
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:49,733
Thereafter, we need to launch our MongoDB server.

20
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,493
This is important to be able to

21
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:54,528
perform database operations and here it's always important

22
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,277
to then keep this server running because you will only

23
00:00:57,277 --> 00:01:00,713
be able to connect to it and to perform database operations

24
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:02,353
if the server is running.

25
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,852
So if you throughout the course,

26
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:06,512
gets some error when starting your node server,

27
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:09,793
and the errors says something about MongoDB,

28
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,956
maybe your MongoDB server is not running,

29
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:14,990
and therefore Node.js is not able to connect to it.

30
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,601
Finally, we also need to launch a client.

31
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,686
So we have the MongoDB server,

32
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:21,975
to be able to, well, interact with it.

33
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:24,267
But the client is where we issue commands like,

34
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,561
save something, get something.

35
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:29,262
We got a shelled client installed with MongoDB,

36
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:31,308
when we do instal it,

37
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:33,721
but we also typically will not use that,

38
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,649
most of the time the client will be

39
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:38,856
our Node.js application connecting to the server.

40
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:41,187
In this module, I will walk you through all these steps,

41
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:44,534
setting up MongoDB, setting up Node.js to use it,

42
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:47,147
and then how to interact with MongoDB.

43
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:51,314
So let's get started with the set up in the next video.
