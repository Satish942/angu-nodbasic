1
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:04,732
<v ->Before connecting Node.js, I want to show you</v>

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:07,628
the other thing which was installed with MongoDB.

3
00:00:07,628 --> 00:00:09,020
I'll open up a new terminal and note,

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,353
keep the server running,

5
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:12,676
and I'll also navigate into the bin folder,

6
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:15,263
or on Windows again choose the right executable,

7
00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:16,884
the name is just Mongo,

8
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,847
so ./mongo when executed from the command line,

9
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:23,088
simply clicking on mongo.exe on Window,

10
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,209
on Windows

11
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:27,213
Mongo, not mongod, that was the server,

12
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:31,539
mongo is now the client, the shell client to be precise.

13
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,573
This is a client which allows us to connect

14
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:37,069
to our MongoDB server through the terminal.

15
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:38,451
We will rarely do this,

16
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:41,173
most of the time Node.js will do that for us,

17
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,112
but from time to time you will see me jump

18
00:00:43,112 --> 00:00:46,105
into the shell client to have a look at the data

19
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:50,204
in the database and get a quick view of what's stored there.

20
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:53,239
The general usage is that you can type use

21
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,912
and then the name of your database

22
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:56,615
to access a specific database,

23
00:00:56,615 --> 00:01:00,016
you may have multiple databases on your Mongo server.

24
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:03,468
The one I'll use through this course is called node-angular,

25
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:07,996
I'll also set this up in my Node.js application later on.

26
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:11,009
So we've used node-angular inside of this

27
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,575
and then with show collections you can show all collections,

28
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,060
MongoDB don't has tables, it has collections of data,

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,671
you have, you see I already have two collections,

30
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,258
it's probably empty for you,

31
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:25,120
I do have them because I already worked with it.

32
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,050
You can then access a collection by typing db, for database,

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,641
the currently selected one, then the name of the collection,

34
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,558
for example messages,

35
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:37,493
and then find, like a method here,

36
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:39,291
to show all messages in there.

37
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,964
Again, this probably won't work for you,

38
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:42,916
but you will see me do this throughout the course

39
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,976
so I want to show it right now.

40
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:46,374
This is the general usage,

41
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,886
and that is all I'm interested in right now.

42
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:50,997
I won't dive super deep into that

43
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:53,180
because you will learn it through the course.

44
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,893
We will use MongoDB a lot there

45
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:56,562
and you will learn how we can access it

46
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:58,071
and how we can work with the data.

47
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:59,762
Not something I want to do in the shell here,

48
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:01,410
just wanted to introduce the shell

49
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,334
so that you are aware of how to start and use it

50
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:08,084
if you see me use it throughout this course.
