1
00:00:01,478 --> 00:00:04,054
<v ->So back in our Node.js application,</v>

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:07,502
or in our project here, I wanna instal Mongoose.

3
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:09,699
It's a third-party package, and we would have to

4
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:12,358
instal the default MongoDB driver,

5
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:13,390
too, if you wanted to use that,

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,814
but I want to use Mongoose, so what I will need

7
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:18,433
to instal is the Mongoose package.

8
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,681
I do this by running npm instal,

9
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:22,692
and then, minus minus save to save it

10
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:25,643
as a production dependency in the package.json file

11
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:28,364
to create an entry there.

12
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:30,482
Whoops, Mongoose is the name.

13
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:33,592
This will pull down Mongoose, and instal it

14
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:36,698
in our project so that we can use it.

15
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:38,390
With the installation finished here,

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,752
again, ignore any warnings you might get,

17
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:43,509
with that finished, you see in the package.json,

18
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,409
Mongoose was added here.

19
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:47,357
So now, we're good to use Mongoose.

20
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,170
How do we use it, then?

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,186
The first step is, we need to connect our app to Mongoose.

22
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,075
We do this in the app.js files,

23
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:58,313
so in every request, we wanna connect to the database.

24
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:02,032
Here, I will create a new variable named mongoose,

25
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:04,699
and that will require the Mongoose package.

26
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,259
So I'm basically pointing to this

27
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,074
Mongoose package we just installed.

28
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:12,218
Now, in order to connect to it on each request,

29
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:16,051
I can now execute mongoose.connect, like this.

30
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:20,709
With this connect function, we will establish a connexion,

31
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,199
but of course, we need to tell it

32
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,404
where the Mongoose server lives.

33
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:27,618
We do so by specifying the path here.

34
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:32,029
Now, the path is something we can figure out

35
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:36,151
by having a look at our running Mongo server.

36
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,996
When starting it up, you see some general

37
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:40,763
information about the path up here.

38
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:44,060
You see that the port is 27017.

39
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,390
And the path instance that is running on our machine,

40
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,408
localhost, so the domain is localhost.

41
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:52,658
So here, we connect to localhost 27017,

42
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:56,250
and then, you add a slash and the name

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,162
of the database you wanna use.

44
00:01:58,162 --> 00:02:01,031
You can add a database you haven't created yet,

45
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:04,150
because it will be created for you on the fly.

46
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,215
So, node-angular is the one I will use

47
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:09,026
throughout this project, and you may specify it like this.

48
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:10,458
It should work.

49
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,391
With that, we're connecting to our MongoDB server

50
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:17,288
through our Node.js application using this Mongoose package.

51
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:20,366
Now, Mongoose is there for more than just connecting us,

52
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:22,792
you will learn, but this is the first basic step

53
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:26,959
to later be able to actually perform database operations.
