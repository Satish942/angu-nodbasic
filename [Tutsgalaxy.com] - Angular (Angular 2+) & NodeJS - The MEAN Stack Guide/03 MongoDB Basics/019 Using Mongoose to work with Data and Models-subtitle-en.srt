1
00:00:01,953 --> 00:00:04,225
<v ->So we got our MongoDB server set up,</v>

2
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:07,861
and we could work with just MongoDB and Node.js.

3
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:11,109
MongoDB ships its own client we can use in Node.js.

4
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:12,518
Remember a client is what connects

5
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:15,011
to the MongoDB server so we could

6
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:17,669
download the Mongo Node client from the

7
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:20,532
Mongo webpage and get started with that,

8
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:22,054
but if you were to use this client,

9
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:24,930
we would have to write all the excess

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,474
and all the query logic on our own.

11
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:30,542
We also wouldn't have features like

12
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,821
using models against which we could verify some data

13
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:35,315
or something like that.

14
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:37,347
So what we will use is a different client

15
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:38,504
not the default one.

16
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:40,960
The one I'll use is called Mongoose.

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,859
Mongoose is more than just a Mongo client.

18
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,450
It is a package which also allows us

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,617
to define schemas, models.

20
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:50,886
So for example, a user should have

21
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:52,530
a first name which is a string,

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,088
a last name which is a string.

23
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,519
You can set up such a configuration,

24
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:59,524
and then you can use this schemas blueprint

25
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:02,432
to create objects based on that model

26
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:04,718
and directly on this object you created,

27
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:06,609
you can then execute database methods

28
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:09,011
like save or delete so you don't have

29
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:10,538
to write the queries on your own.

30
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,083
You also get this extra validation

31
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,040
if the data you create actually fits

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,761
the model you set up, and this is

33
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:18,844
why Mongoose is so great.
