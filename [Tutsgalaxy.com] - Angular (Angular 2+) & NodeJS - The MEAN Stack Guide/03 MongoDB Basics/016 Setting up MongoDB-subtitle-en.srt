1
00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:03,777
<v ->You wanna head over to mongodb.com</v>

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:07,455
which is the official webpage of MongoDB.

3
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:10,842
And here, download is the link we wanna use.

4
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:12,806
Now on the download centre, make sure

5
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:15,716
to use the right version, which would be

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:19,008
the community server for the testing purposes here.

7
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:21,978
Then your operating system, and then the version

8
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:25,301
you wanna use, the default version should be fine.

9
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:27,648
Thereafter, you may download this

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,592
and depending on your operating system,

11
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:31,580
you can also follow through the

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,196
installation instructions here to understand

13
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,012
how to use that download.

14
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:37,839
On Windows, it should be installer.

15
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:40,195
On OS X it stays package.

16
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:42,636
So let's simply download it here.

17
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:44,875
You don't need to register there,

18
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,509
it will start automatically.

19
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:50,710
And after this download finished, I'll be back.

20
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,562
I'm in the downloads folder where I downloaded this.

21
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:55,388
On any operating system you should be able

22
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,666
to double-click on it, and on Windows

23
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,559
it should start an installer.

24
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,718
In Mac it will give you this folder.

25
00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:04,768
Now this folder already has everything you need

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,491
in the bin folder, you have multiple executables

27
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:10,177
you can run through the terminal.

28
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:12,172
I will show you how to do that in a second.

29
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,416
Which allow you to start your Mongo server

30
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,037
with this executable or your client

31
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:17,790
with this executable.

32
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,582
You may now move this whole folder

33
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:23,934
and rename to any place on your machine

34
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:25,477
where you wanna store it and where you

35
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:27,515
later on also wanna access it.

36
00:01:27,515 --> 00:01:30,185
Now to successfully set up your environment

37
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:32,713
to use MongoDB, then make sure to

38
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:34,670
go to this quick start guide.

39
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,039
It should automatically redirect

40
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,672
to the one for your operating system.

41
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:40,670
You may choose the right version

42
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,329
otherwise here on the left.

43
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,693
And make sure to follow these steps here.

44
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:48,011
Now we already did instal it.

45
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:50,971
The important part for us is to now

46
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,687
configure it correctly.

47
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:54,768
You may add this path variable here,

48
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:55,900
but you don't need to do that.

49
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,155
I will show you how to use without this

50
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:58,488
extra step here.

51
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,806
But important is that you create

52
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:04,019
this data directory here.

53
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,993
So make sure to definitely follow

54
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,656
this step here to set up this directory

55
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:10,365
which will be the directory holding

56
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:12,545
the actual data later on.

57
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:14,890
The directory we downloaded holds the

58
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,384
server and the code we need to

59
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:18,915
execute our server, but in this data directory

60
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:21,250
which should create with these easy steps here,

61
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,659
the data will be stored thereafter.

62
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,501
So make sure to execute the steps

63
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,582
one and two there regarding running MongoDB.

64
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,999
I'll come back to this in the next video.
