1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,757
<v Instructor>We installed MongoDB</v>

2
00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:04,219
in the last video, and make sure

3
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,953
you also set up your data directory

4
00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:08,281
as described in the official docs.

5
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:10,570
After doing that, on Mac on Linux,

6
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,667
navigate into this MongoDB folder

7
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,919
you downloaded, extracted, and then moved

8
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,267
somewhere in the terminal.

9
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,782
On Windows you may just go there

10
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:20,992
in the Windows explorer.

11
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,837
Then in this folder, you should have

12
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:26,071
this bin folder or directly in

13
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:27,940
the MongoDB folder which was installed

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,632
through the Windows Installer,

15
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:32,067
you should have executables named

16
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,591
Mongo D and Mongo, for example.

17
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:37,009
On Mac and Linux, you have to go into

18
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:39,284
the bin folder in MongoDB, in the MongoDB

19
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:41,832
folder to get there, and then we're running

20
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:44,690
dot slash mongod, you will start

21
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,335
the MongoDB server.

22
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:49,042
This starts the server and keep it running,

23
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:50,253
don't close it as long as you're

24
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:51,795
working on your project because

25
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:53,086
if you close it, you're of course

26
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,062
not able to access it anymore,

27
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:56,867
and any tries if you exit it will

28
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:58,590
crash your application.

29
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,039
So just keep MongoDB running, and if you've got

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,610
any problems running this, head back

31
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,374
to the official documentation.

32
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:05,978
This quick start guide is really great,

33
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:07,924
and it should give you detailed instructions

34
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:10,315
for your operating system on how to

35
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:12,593
set it up correctly and run it

36
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:14,951
both on Windows, as described here,

37
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,498
or OS X, as I already showed you

38
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:19,443
here in this video.

39
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:21,374
Now with that server running,

40
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:24,227
we're able to work with it and to

41
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:26,060
write some data to it.
